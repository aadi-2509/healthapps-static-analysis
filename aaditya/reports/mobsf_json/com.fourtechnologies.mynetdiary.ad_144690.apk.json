A target heart rate during exercise depends upon your age, fitness level, and medication use.\n\nIf you don\u2019t use a fitness device that monitors heart rate, you can measure it yourself. To measure your wrist pulse, lightly press the tips of your index and middle fingers over the artery on the thumb side of your wrist. To measure your neck (carotid) pulse, lightly press the tips of your index and middle fingers over the artery on side of your neck, just below the jaw, and to the side of your windpipe.

A lower resting heart rate is generally associated with increased fitness and cardiovascular health. Medications, stress, caffeine intake, nicotine, and illness can also affect resting heart rate.\n\nResting Heart Rate is usually calculated by a wearable fitness device estimating your lowest heart rate during periods of rest. If you don\u2019t use a device that monitors heart rate, you can measure it yourself. To measure your wrist pulse, lightly press the tips of your index and middle fingers over the artery on the thumb-side of your wrist. To measure your neck (carotid) pulse, lightly press the tips of your index and middle fingers over the artery on the side of your neck, just below the jaw, and to the side of your windpipe. With either method, count your pulse for 30 seconds, then double it to find your beats per minute.\"",
