      "\"E460ii_long_description\" : \"Cellulose is an additive that can be used (among other things) as an emulsifier, a stabilizer, a thickening agent, a gelling agent, or a coating agent. However, it is classified as an emulsifier. Emulsifiers make it possible to create an emulsion of two liquids that do not mix (e.g., oil and water).\n\nIn a re-evaluation from 2018, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) deemed that this additive provided no cause for concern and that the available data did not point to any risk of genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, or reproductive toxicity. Nevertheless, this opinion does not take into account some recent, more incriminating studies regarding emulsifiers.\n\nIn 2023, a study by INSERM (the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research) found that higher intakes of cellulose (in particular, cellulose gum) can lead to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (up to +7%). Further studies are required to confirm this finding.\n\nMoreover, the EFSA did not study digestive upset or the risks of increased intestinal permeability or changes to intestinal flora, concerns raised by recent animal studies.\n\nIndeed, some studies suggest that emulsifiers modify intestinal permeability, causing intestinal barrier dysfunction. They may thus increase the risk of auto-immune disorders (such as Crohn's disease) and allergies.\n\nOther studies suggest that emulsifiers may disrupt the intestinal flora and promote inflammation, increasing the risk of inflammatory diseases and metabolic syndrome. Inflammation resulting from modification of the flora by emulsifiers may even promote the development of colon cancer, according to a recent study (Viennois, 2017).\n\nMoreover, EFSA experts have requested a review of the specifications pertaining to this additive (heavy metal and solvent residue levels, etc.). Indeed, the Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources Added to Food (ANS) noted gaps in the conclusions and recommendations in opinions published in 2018 (regarding heavy metal levels, for example). In 2023, the EFSA therefore launched a call for data. A scientific opinion is expected shortly from the EFSA that takes into account the new information.\"",

It is banned in many countries (including the countries of Europe since 2005) but approved in quantities of up to 45 ppm in flours (parts per million) in the United States and Canada.\n\nIt is mainly found in breads (sandwich breads, muffin breads, etc.) and packaged bakery goods such as croissants.\n\nADC is dangerous because it can degrade and form semicarbazide (SEM). In an evaluation on semicarbazide from 2005, the EFSA (European Food Safety Authority) found little risk to European consumers. However, several studies have shown that at a certain level, the substance becomes carcinogenic. As a result, azodicarbonamide has been banned in Europe.\"",

      "\"E252_long_description\" : \"Nitrates are preservatives extensively used in the food industry, particularly in processed meats. These additives are added to meat products to extend shelf life, maintain color, and enhance flavor. They are also used to prevent certain cheeses from bloating during fermentation.\n\nNitrates can be converted into nitrites in food during storage, or in the mouth or stomach of humans after ingestion. This is concerning as nitrites have been associated with various toxic effects on human health.\n\nWhen added to meat, nitrites can form a group of compounds known as nitrosamines, some of which are classified as \u201cprobably carcinogenic to humans\u201d by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and as genotoxic (capable of altering cellular DNA) by the French National Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health Safety (ANSES). In 2010, IARC also classified nitrites as \u201cprobably carcinogenic to humans\u201d (Group 2A) when ingested under conditions favorable to the formation of nitrosamines. The 2023 report by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) stated that exposure to nitrosamines in food, particularly meat products, \u201craises a public health concern\u201d. It concluded that all age groups are affected by a significant exceedance of safe levels and the increased risk of developing cancer. \n\nAccording to the 2017 EFSA report, studies have shown some evidence linking the combination of nitrite plus nitrate from processed meat and colorectal cancer. A positive association between the dietary intake of nitrites and gastric cancer risk was also suggested. In its 2022 report, ANSES confirmed a positive association between exposure to nitrates and/or nitrites and the risk of colorectal cancer. A suspected correlation was also observed with other types of cancer (breast, bladder, pancreatic, stomach, esophageal, prostate), as well as an increased risk of cancer mortality.\n\n\nFurthermore, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), nitrites can convert the hemoglobin in blood into methemoglobin, causing a condition known as methemoglobinemia, which impairs the ability of red blood cells to deliver oxygen throughout the body. The WHO also states that infants and the elderly are at greater risk of developing methemoglobinemia. A 2021 publication goes as far as to affirm that nitrites used as preservatives in foods are potential \u201ctriggering agents\u201d for this disease. Other susceptible individuals include adults with a genetic predisposition, those suffering from peptic ulcers, chronic gastritis or renal failure, and dialysis patients.\n\nThe JECFA (Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives) established an acceptable daily intake (ADI) in 2002 to avoid the risk of effects on the blood and also reported that effects on the heart and lungs\u201d had been observed in rats.\n\nIn 2017, the EFSA stated that certain consumers are at risk of exceeding the ADI established in Europe (very close to the limit set by the WHO), which would expose them to a health hazard, but decided to maintain the current ADI. This is even more worrisome considering that the ADI does not fully take account of the risks associated with the formation of nitrosated compounds. \n\nThis risk of exceeding the ADI is attributable to several factors: the use of nitrites and nitrates as additives in foodstuffs; the fact that they occur naturally in certain vegetables (particularly spinach and lettuce) and in water. The presence of nitrates in water is due to their use in intensive farming methods, livestock production, and wastewater discharge.\n\nBased on the ANSES recommendations, which called for a reduction in the use of nitrate additives as part of a \u201chealth safety objective\u201d approach, on March 27, 2023, the French government announced an \u201cAction plan to reduce the use of nitrite/nitrate additives in food\u201d. The plan sets out a three-stage trajectory for the reduction or elimination of nitrite/nitrate additives in food.\n\nIn the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has permitted the use of nitrites in salmon and meat products at defined maximum levels since 1977. However, these limits are more lenient than European regulations, where allowable levels are 3 to 5 times lower, particularly in meat products.\"",

      "\"E340_long_description\" : \"Phosphates have several functions: leavening agents, stabilizers, acidity regulators, and humectants. They are found in bakery products, processed meats, dairy products, among others.\n\nPhosphates contain phosphorus, a chemical element essential for the body, involved in numerous biochemical reactions and in bone mineral mass. Therefore, there is a recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for phosphorus. It is naturally present in animal and plant products. However, according to a 2015 opinion by the French Agency for Food, Environmental, and Occupational Health & Safety (ANSES), phosphorus intake in Europe exceeds the RDA by 2 to 3 times, mainly due to the consumption of phosphate additives and high consumption of meat and dairy products. National surveys in the United States from 2015-2016 show a similar trend: Americans exceed recommended phosphorus levels by 1.5 to 3 times, depending on age group. Moreover, scientific reviews from 2013 and 2019 highlight that phosphorus intake in the U.S. is underestimated by more than 20% in nutritional databases. This underestimation may be worsened by the rise of fast food and out-of-home meals, where nutritional information is often missing or incomplete.\n\nAccording to several studies conducted between 2012 and 2023, excess phosphorus could have various problematic effects. It is notably detrimental to the kidneys: when the kidneys\u2019 capacity to eliminate it is exceeded, phosphorus can accumulate in the blood. Individuals with kidney disease must be particularly cautious. Excess phosphorus in the blood would disrupt calcium metabolism and bone mineralization, potentially leading to osteoporosis. It is also suspected to cause vascular calcification, which may be associated with higher cardiovascular mortality. Additionally, phosphates from food additives are more easily absorbed and may have more detrimental effects on cardiovascular health than those naturally present in foods.\n\nStudies conducted in 2023 and 2024 by the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM) also suggest a link between high consumption of certain phosphate additives and increased risks of certain chronic diseases. These studies observed a 45% increase in premenopausal breast cancer risk for diphosphates and a 77% increase for potassium phosphate, a 15% increase in type 2 diabetes risk for potassium phosphate, and a 6% increase in coronary heart disease risk for sodium phosphate. However, INSERM states that further research is needed to confirm these correlations.\n\nThe European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) estimated in 2019 that phosphate intake could exceed the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) for infants, children, and adolescents with a diet high in phosphates. Additionally, people with kidney disease, estimated to be 10% of the population, may not tolerate the ADI due to their vulnerability. EFSA also concluded that current evidence is insufficient to establish a clear link between excess dietary phosphorus and cardiovascular diseases and recommended further studies. It is important to note that this opinion does not take into account the aforementioned 2024 INSERM study, which offers new perspectives.\nIn the United States, phosphate additives have been recognized as \u201cgenerally recognized as safe\u201d (GRAS) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) since the 1970s. According to U.S. regulations, their use is limited in certain product categories: industrial cheeses and acidified milks, bakery products, ice cream, jams, and cocoa-based products. For other product categories, there is no maximum amount to be adhered to.\n\nBetween 2014 and 2016, several initiatives were launched in the U.S. to urge the FDA to mandate phosphorus content labeling on products. Organizations such as the American Society of Nephrology and the National Kidney Foundation led various actions to demand such labeling, to no avail so far.\"",

      "\"E473a_long_description\" : \"Sucrose esters of fatty acids are emulsifiers commonly used in beverages, dairy products, and baked goods to enhance the stability of oil and water mixtures. Additionally, they are applied to the surface of fruits like apples to prolong their shelf life and give them a shiny appearance.\n\nStudies published between 2011 and 2024 highlight a potential risk associated with emulsifiers in general: their effects on gut health. These studies suggest that emulsifiers could alter intestinal permeability and disrupt the gut microbiome. As a result, they may promote inflammation and contribute to an increased risk of various diseases, including autoimmune diseases (such as Crohn's disease), allergies, metabolic syndrome, and cancer. A 2024 study specifically suggests that ingesting sucrose esters of fatty acids may increase intestinal permeability, alter gut microbiome diversity, and lead to dysbiosis (imbalance of gut microbiota). Additionally, this study observed that sucrose esters of fatty acids could induce insulin resistance, affecting the hormone that regulates blood sugar levels.\n\nThis additive may also contain acetaldehyde residues. Acetaldehyde is categorized as \"possibly carcinogenic to humans\" (Group 2B) and as a confirmed carcinogen (Group 1) when consumed with alcohol, according to the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). In the European Union, a maximum limit of 50 ppm (mg/kg) has been set, unlike in the United States, where this component is not regulated.\n\nThe European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) also highlighted in 2023 the risks related to the presence of toxic heavy metals, such as arsenic, mercury, cadmium, and lead, which may be present in this additive. Consequently, EFSA has recommended lowering the maximum allowable limits for these contaminants to minimize health risks. In the United States, limits for arsenic are identical to those in Europe, while limits for lead are five times higher. There are no specific limits for cadmium and mercury.\n\nEFSA has repeatedly assessed the safety of sucrose esters of fatty acids, with ongoing concerns about excessive exposure in certain populations, particularly young children. In 2010, an excess of the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) was observed among adults and children who are high consumers of products containing this additive. The primary exposure source was fresh fruit coated with this additive. For fresh fruit, the additive was authorized under the principle of *quantum satis*, meaning no maximum limit is set, but its use must avoid abuse or excessive application.\n\nIn response, in 2012, industry significantly reduced dosing for fruit treatment, cutting usage by more than 780 times. Despite this reduction, in 2018, EFSA observed ADI exceedances among children, adolescents, and adults who are high consumers of products containing this additive. The 2018 assessment found that exposure levels in children could reach up to three times the ADI at reported industry use levels and up to seven times the ADI when used at maximum permitted levels.\n\nIn 2024, during a European Commission meeting, Member States agreed that fruit coating additives (including sucrose esters of fatty acids) should only be allowed if technologically necessary for fruits with inedible skins and intended for extended transport, such as tropical fruits. The Commission proposed removing authorization for these additives on apples, pears, and peaches, as these are fruits with commonly consumed skins. A regulatory amendment proposal was submitted to Member States, with a response requested by the end of June 2024. As of now, no regulatory change has been implemented.\n\nIn the United States, sucrose esters of fatty acids are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as emulsifiers, stabilizers, or texturizers in various product categories, including baked goods, certain dairy products, chewing gum, and frozen desserts. They are also authorized as coating agents for certain fresh fruits, such as apples, avocados, bananas, plantains, limes, melons, papayas, peaches, pears, pineapples, and plums. The composition of this additive must also meet FDA specifications, particularly regarding the presence of contaminants such as heavy metals.\"",

      "\"E150_long_description\" : \"This color additive brings together under the same name (\u201ccaramel color\u201d) 4 different classes of caramel coloring presenting different levels of health risk. Unlike European regulations which require that the type of caramel used by manufacturers be indicated on product labels, the US FDA (Food and Drug Administration) and Health Canada make no distinction between them: the same term is used to describe any class.\n\nThe 4 classes of caramel coloring differ in their method of manufacture and composition:\n \n1. Caramel Color I (also called plain caramel, caustic caramel or E150a in Europe); this class is prepared by heating carbohydrates with or without acids or alkalis. Plain caramel is not harmful to human health.\n \n2. Caramel Color II (also called caustic sulfite caramel or E150b); this class is prepared by the controlled heat treatment of carbohydrates in the presence of sulfite compounds. Sulfites can cause allergies or intolerance reactions in some individuals.\n \n3. Caramel Color III (also called ammonia caramel or E150c); this class is prepared by the controlled heat treatment of carbohydrates with ammonium compounds. During the manufacturing process, two problematic compounds are formed which can be found in trace amounts in caramel at the conclusion of the production process:\n \n\u2022 4-MEI (4-methylimidazole): it has been classified as \u201cpossibly carcinogenic to humans\u201d (group 2B) by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and listed as a carcinogen by California\u2019s Proposition 65 law \u201cSafe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986\u201d (OEHHA, 2011). As a result, any product sold in California that contains 4-MEI concentrations corresponding to exposures that pose excess cancer risks (1 case per 100,000 exposed persons) and is set at 29 \u03bcg 4-MEI/day, has to carry a warning label. The FDA is currently reviewing all available data on the safety of 4-MEI to determine what, if any, regulatory action needs to be taken.\n \n\u2022 THI (2-Acetyl-4(5)-tetrahydroxybutylimidazole): this component can be toxic to the immune system.\n \n4. Caramel Color IV (also called sulfite ammonia caramel or E150d); this class is prepared by heating carbohydrates with ammonium-containing and sulfite-containing compounds. During the manufacturing process, compounds suspected to be carcinogenic (4-MEI) are formed. Residue of this compound can be found in caramel at the end of the production process. Moreover, sulfites are used in the production of this color additive which may trigger allergies or intolerance reactions in some individuals.\n \nClass III and Class IV caramel coloring are the most commonly used food color additives by volume.\n \n\u201cThere is no requirement in FDA\u2019s regulations that the ingredient statement on the label of foods that contain Class III or Class IV caramel coloring list the color additive by name or type. It is therefore not possible, unless voluntarily disclosed, to know based on the label if a food contains Class III or IV caramel coloring \u201cconfirms the FDA.\"",

Its research demonstrated no effect, whether positive or negative, of intense sweeteners on weight control.

More broadly, the issue of nutritional risks linked to consumption of sweeteners remains unclear.

      "\"E211_long_description\" : \"Benzoic acid and its salts (sodium benzoate and potassium benzoate) are preservatives mainly found in sodas, fruit juices, and sauces. They are used for controlling microorganisms and preventing food oxidation.\n\nOne of the concerns regarding this additive lies in its potential to form benzene when combined with ascorbic acid (in the form of natural vitamin C or as an additive). Benzene is classified as a carcinogen for humans (Group 1) by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). This risk of a potentially dangerous chemical interaction underscores the importance of carefully monitoring ingredients in food products that combine these two compounds, particularly flavored soft drinks. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) noted this interaction in its 2016 opinion. It recommended considering the formulation and storage conditions of soft drinks to minimize benzene formation, as higher storage temperatures can contribute to this formation.\n\nAnother concern about this additive is the potential risk of exceeding the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) in children. According to the 2016 EFSA opinion, young children who are heavy consumers of foods containing this additive, particularly flavored drinks, could exceed the ADI. Additionally, as early as 1974, the World Health Organization (WHO) established an ADI of 5 mg/kg body weight/day, based on studies that revealed reprotoxic effects (toxic effects on reproduction) in rats.\n\nMore recently, a 2020 study reinforced concerns about this additive, showing that it could disrupt sperm formation and function, as well as sex hormone levels. That same year, other research highlighted toxic effects on blood and the immune system after prolonged exposure to doses close to the ADI. Furthermore, studies conducted in 2021 and 2023 observed signs of renal and hepatic toxicity in rats.\n\nThe EFSA also indicated in 2016 that this additive could increase hypersensitivity and provoke skin reactions. Various cases of intolerance to benzoic acid and its salts have been reported in scientific literature, including skin reactions, gastrointestinal disorders, bronchial hyperreactivity, asthma attacks, and effects on the central nervous system. These reactions can occur even at doses lower than the ADI in individuals sensitive to benzoate.\n\nThis preservative is also suspected of contributing to hyperactivity and attention deficit disorders in children when combined with certain colorants. However, the EFSA ruled out this risk in its 2008 and 2016 re-evaluations. The EFSA acknowledges that the results of the main incriminating study show a real impact on some individuals particularly sensitive to food additives and/or colorants. However, the EFSA expert committee emphasizes that these results cannot be generalized to the entire population.\n\nFinally, the EFSA recommends revising the maximum limits for toxic element impurities (lead, mercury, and arsenic) related to benzoic acid and its salts to ensure that additives do not become a significant source of exposure to these toxic elements.\n\nIn the United States, this preservative is part of the \u201cGenerally Recognized as Safe\u201d (GRAS) substances by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), but its use and dosage are limited based on product categories. This additive was approved by the FDA in 1973, which has not published a new opinion since, taking into account more recent studies on this additive.\"",

Many types of food contain phosphates, including baked goods, processed meat, and dairy products.\n\nPhosphates contain phosphorus, a chemical element essential for many biological processes. Notably, it is involved in many of the body's biochemical reactions, as well as in bone mineral density. Therefore, a recommended dietary allowance (RDA) has been established for phosphorous. Phosphorus is naturally present in animal-based and plant-based products. However, according to the 2015 opinion of the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety. (ANSES), phosphorus intakes in Europe are 2 to 3 times greater than the RDA, primarily due to the widespread use of phosphate food additives and the high consumption of meat and dairy products. National surveys in the United States conducted from 2015-2016 show a similar trend: Americans consume 1.5 to 3 times the RDA of phosphorous, depending on their age group. In addition, scientific reviews from 2013 and 2019 indicate that phosphorus intakes in the United States are underestimated by more than 20% in nutrition databases. This underestimation could be exacerbated by the increase in the use of fast-food and away-from-home establishments, where nutritional information is often missing or incomplete. \n\nAccording to several studies conducted between 2012 and 2023, excessive dietary phosphorus intake can cause many health problems. It may be directly harmful to the kidneys because when the kidneys' capacity to filter out excess phosphorus is exceeded, it can accumulate in the blood. Therefore, people with kidney disease need to carefully monitor their phosphorus intake. Excess phosphorus in the blood could also disrupt calcium metabolism and bone mineralization, which could lead to osteoporosis. It is also suspected of promoting vascular calcification, which is associated with increased cardiovascular mortality. In addition, phosphates from inorganic food additives are more easily absorbed and may have more adverse effects on cardiovascular health than those naturally present in food.\n\nStudies conducted in 2023 and 2024 by the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM) also suggest direct associations between high intakes of some phosphate additives and an increased risk of some chronic diseases. These studies observed a 77% increase in the risk of breast cancer (in premenopausal women) for diphosphates, a 15% increase in the risk of type 2 diabetes for potassium phosphate, and a 6% increase in the risk of coronary heart disease for sodium phosphate. However, INSERM concluded that further research is required to confirm these correlations.\n\nIn 2019, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) determined that phosphate intake could exceed the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) in infants, children, and adolescents with a high phosphate diet. In addition, vulnerable patients with kidney disease, which affects 10% of the general population, may not be able to tolerate the ADI. EFSA also concluded that current evidence was insufficient to establish a clear link between excess dietary phosphorus and cardiovascular disease and therefore, further studies were recommended. It is important to note that this opinion does not consider the previously mentioned 2024 Inserm study, which provides new perspectives. \n\nIn the United States, phosphate additives are substances that have been \u201cgenerally recognized as safe\u201d (GRAS) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) since the 1970s. Under US regulations, their use is limited in certain product categories: industrial and acidified cheeses and milk, baked goods, ice cream, jams, and cocoa products. There is no maximum allowable quantity for the other product categories.\n\nBetween 2014 and 2016, several initiatives were launched in the United States to urge the FDA to require the mandatory listing of phosphorus content on product labels. Organizations such as the American Society of Nephrology and the National Kidney Foundation have taken action to advocate for this labeling, but their efforts have been unsuccessful to date.\"",

These effects were taken into account in the last Scientific Committee for Food (SCF) report in 2000 on the safety of cyclamates, and to establish the ADI at 7 mg/kg body weight/day.\n\nIn 2015, the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety (ANSES) found a \"lack of nutritional benefit\" for the consumption of intense sweeteners. Its research demonstrated no effect, whether positive or negative, of intense sweeteners on weight control. The ANSES also recommends studying the possible interactions between body size, consumption of intense sweeteners and weight gain. More broadly, the issue of nutritional risks linked to consumption of sweeteners remains unclear. Moreover, some recent data suggests a link between consumption of sweeteners and weight gain. \n\nAccording to a 2020 study, cyclamate supplementation may lead to weight gain and higher food intake.\n\nIn addition, a 2019 in vitro study suggests that cyclamates may be toxic to bone cells.\n\nIn general, sweeteners may also disturb the intestinal flora and promote metabolic disorders, particularly the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.

These additives are used in a variety of products \u2014 including baked goods such as baker's yeast, pizza dough, muffins, etc. \u2014 to improve the homogeneity and texture of dough. \n\nIn a study from 2021, this additive was found to affect human gut microbiota, in particular by promoting inflammation and causing a change in the latter's composition. Sorbitan monostearate has also been found to contribute to an increased risk of diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease.\n\nIn our bodies, sorbitan esters are broken down into sorbitol and sorbitol fatty acids. According to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), these by-products are safe: the fatty acids are used by the body, and the sorbitol is eliminated through urine and feces. Nevertheless, a study from 2017 found that a high consumption of products containing sorbitol can lead to digestive problems such as gas, bloating, and diarrhea, in particular due to sorbitol's laxative properties and its intolerance in certain people.\n\nIn 2017, the EFSA ruled out the risk of genotoxicity (a substance's ability to damage DNA), but the effects on gut microbiota were not evaluated due to a lack of studies on the subject at that time. The EFSA underscored the general lack of long-term studies which are required to better assess the chronic effects of this additive. However, it indicated that studies on the acute effects were sufficient to establish an acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 10 mg of sorbitan per day per kg of body weight. \n\nThe EFSA also stressed the need to reduce the current limits for certain toxic elements (arsenic, cadmium, lead, and mercury) present in these additives to avoid excessive dietary exposures.\n\nIn addition, the committee emphasized the lack of data on the types and usage levels of sorbitan esters, as well as analytical data on their actual presence in food products. This lack of data makes assessments of actual consumer exposure to these additives less precise and less realistic. \n\nThis additive is authorized in the United States by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration), and is subject to compliance with precise manufacturing specifications and concentration limits defined according to its use and its combination with other emulsifiers. \n\n\"",

      "\"E960_long_description\" : \"Steviol glycosides are intense sweeteners made from a South American plant called Stevia rebaudiana. This plant naturally contains a blend of steviol glycosides (primarily stevioside, rebaudioside A, rebaudioside C, and dulcoside A). This combination of glycosides is more than 300 times sweeter than sugar (sucrose) and has no calories. For this reason, this additive is often used as a sugar substitute in so-called \"diet\" products.\n\nIn 2015, the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety (ANSES) found a \"lack of nutritional benefit\" for the consumption of intense sweeteners, including steviol glycosides. Its research demonstrated no effect, whether positive or negative, of intense sweeteners on weight control. The ANSES also recommends studying the possible interactions between body size, consumption of intense sweeteners and weight gain. More broadly, the issue of nutritional risks linked to consumption of sweeteners remains unclear. Moreover, some recent data suggests a link between consumption of sweeteners and weight gain. \n\nIn general, sweeteners may also disturb the intestinal flora and promote metabolic disorders, particularly the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. In addition, a study by the French National Institute for Health and Medical Research (Inserm) demonstrated that diet beverages are associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes.\n\nFinally, two Inserm studies published in 2022 suggest an association between the overall consumption of sweeteners and an increased risk of cancer and cardiovascular disease Steviol glycosides were among the sweeteners studied in these two analyses, through a cumulative consumption with other sweeteners.\n\nE960/E960a is a relatively new additive (approved for use in the European Union since 2011), and more research is needed on its long-term effects. An extension of use was approved by the EFSA in 2015: while acknowledging that only infants in the Netherlands are exposed to doses above the ADI, the EFSA generally considers that the use of E960a does not pose a health risk. It has only recently been learned that steviol glycosides can be metabolized by the intestinal flora; only steviol is absorbed by the intestine, processed in the liver, and eliminated through the urine. The effects of steviol glycosides on the intestinal flora and the possible nutritional risks remain unexplored.\"",

They are used as emulsifiers to mix normally immiscible substances (such as water and oil), and as stabilizers to prevent the formation of deposits. They are found in salad dressings, ice creams, broths, and coconut milks and creams.\n\nDuring its reevaluation of polysorbates in 2015, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) indicated that the data available at the time was insufficient to assess actual exposure to these additives, but that certain population groups (in particular, young children) risked exceeding the acceptable daily intake (ADI) for this group of additives. Nevertheless, the EFSA ruled out risks related to genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, and reproductive toxicity. It acknowledged the existence of incriminating data with regard to intestinal microbiota, but did not formally take this data into account in its risk assessment. Ultimately, the EFSA recommended that the maximum limits for the impurities of toxic elements (such as lead, mercury, and arsenic) be revised to ensure that polysorbates do not represent a significant source of exposure to these toxic elements.\n\nBetween 2015 and 2024 (since the EFSA evaluation), emulsifiers have been the subject of several studies highlighting their potentially harmful effects, particularly on the gut. These studies suggest that emulsifiers can disrupt the gut microbiota, leading to chronic inflammation that can contribute to the development of chronic diseases such as obesity, type II diabetes, cancer, and inflammatory bowel disease. A 2020 study showed that polysorbate 80 may increase intestinal permeability, allowing harmful substances and pathogens to enter the body more easily and thereby increasing vulnerability to toxins and infections. More recently, in 2023, a study showed that polysorbate 80 may inhibit the growth of probiotics, bacteria that are essential to the proper functioning of the gut, all the while promoting harmful bacteria that may cause relapses in people suffering from Crohn's disease.\n\nIn 2024, a study by the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM) examined the potential link between polysorbate 80 consumption and the risk of cancer. Although the results showed no direct link, the researchers did highlight one major limitation: the subjects consumed much less polysorbate 80 than those observed in other studies. This difference could explain why the study established no direct link. The study also raised a wider concern: people consuming large quantities of emulsifiers in general could be exposed to an increased risk of cancer.\n \nIn the USA, polysorbate 80 was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1978, albeit with specific manufacturing specifications and concentration limits depending on the type of use. Despite the concerns raised by recent research, the FDA has not changed its rules on this additive since providing its initial approval.\"",

The new requirements only apply in the EU, which means that unhealthy concentrations of toxic contaminants may be present in products in other countries.\"",

      "\"E341ii_long_description\" : \"Phosphates have several functions: leavening agents, stabilizers, acidity regulators, and humectants. Many types of food contain phosphates, including baked goods, processed meat, and dairy products.\n\nPhosphates contain phosphorus, a chemical element essential for many biological processes. Notably, it is involved in many of the body's biochemical reactions, as well as in bone mineral density. Therefore, a recommended dietary allowance (RDA) has been established for phosphorous. Phosphorous is naturally present in animal-based and plant-based products. However, according to the 2015 opinion of the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety. (ANSES), phosphorus intakes in Europe are 2 to 3 times greater than the RDA, primarily due to the widespread use of phosphate food additives and the high consumption of meat and dairy products. National surveys in the United States conducted from 2015-2016 show a similar trend: Americans consume 1.5 to 3 times the RDA of phosphorous, depending on their age group. In addition, scientific reviews from 2013 and 2019 indicate that phosphorus intakes in the United States are underestimated by more than 20% in nutrition databases. This underestimation could be exacerbated by the increase in the use of fast-food and away-from-home establishments, where nutritional information is often missing or incomplete. \n\nAccording to several studies conducted between 2012 and 2023, excessive dietary phosphorus intake can cause many health problems. It may be directly harmful to the kidneys because when the kidneys' capacity to filter out excess phosphorus is exceeded, it can accumulate in the blood. Therefore, people with kidney disease need to carefully monitor their phosphorus intake. Excess phosphorus in the blood could also disrupt calcium metabolism and bone mineralization, which could lead to osteoporosis. It is also suspected of promoting vascular calcification, which is highly associated with increased cardiovascular mortality. In addition, phosphates from inorganic food additives are more easily absorbed and may have more adverse effects on cardiovascular health than those naturally present in food.\n\nStudies conducted in 2023 and 2024 by the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM) also suggest direct associations between high intakes of some phosphate additives (like potassium phosphate, sodium phosphate, and diphosphates) and an increased risk of certain chronic diseases. However, INSERM concluded that further research is required to confirm these correlations.\n\nIn 2019, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) determined that phosphate intake could exceed the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) in infants, children, and adolescents with a high phosphate diet. In addition, vulnerable patients with kidney disease, which affects 10% of the general population, may not be able to tolerate the ADI. EFSA also concluded that current evidence was insufficient to establish a clear link between excess dietary phosphorus and cardiovascular disease and therefore, further studies were recommended. It is important to note that this opinion does not consider the previously mentioned 2024 Inserm study, which provides new perspectives. \n\nAnother source of concern is its presence in the form of nanoparticles, which, because of their small size, can penetrate the body more easily. They are also more reactive, potentially toxic and can accumulate in different organs. Their ability to interact differently with the body compared to larger particles is a concern that has been highlighted by several studies. In 2020, ANSES warned that calcium and magnesium phosphates in nanoparticle form could be present in certain products, notably infant formula, and commercially produced cakes and cookies.\"",

There is no maximum allowable quantity for the other product categories.\n\nBetween 2014 and 2016, several initiatives were launched in the United States to urge the FDA to require the mandatory listing of phosphorus content on product labels.

In particular, vision-related issues have been reported. On the other hand, the EFSA has deemed this additive to be perfectly safe for the general population. Nevertheless, this opinion does not take into account some recent, more incriminating studies regarding emulsifiers. \n\nIn fact, a study by INSERM (the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research) in 2024 found a direct correlation between the consumption of this additive and a heightened risk of premenopausal breast cancer (+44-55%).

Unlike intense sweeteners, bulk sweeteners have less sweetening power than sugar (sucrose). \n\nMannitol may be natural (from mushrooms or seaweed) or synthetic. It has half the sweetening power of sugar (sucrose). In the industry, it is derived from starch (most often corn starch). It can also be used for its texture properties, to thicken or stabilize products.\n\nIn the event of heavy consumption, mannitol may cause digestive issues (diarrhea, bloating, flatulence). As a result, foodstuffs containing more than 10% mannitol must bear the statement, \"Excess consumption may have a laxative effect.\" Moreover, mannitol is prohibited for use in beverages and baby products.\n\nGenerally speaking, sweeteners may also disrupt the intestinal flora and promote metabolic disorders, particularly the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Although mannitol and other bulk sweeteners lead to a better glycemic response than sugar, few studies have been conducted on their impact on the intestinal flora, weight gain, or the risk of type 2 diabetes.\n\nThe European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has planned to re-evaluate bulk and intense sweeteners by December 2020. In connection with this, it launched appeals for toxicological (2017) and compositional data (2018) from the industry. Mannitol will be re-evaluated in light of these new data.\"",

MSG is associated with the \u201cumami\u201d taste, often referred to as the fifth flavor. It is found in many processed foods, such as baked goods, soups, broths, sauces, seasonings, meats, and meat-based products. MSG is also widely used in Chinese cuisine.\n\nStudies from 2019 to 2024 suggest that excessive consumption of MSG may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. This could be explained by several mechanisms. On one hand, at high doses, this additive may contribute to the development of glucose intolerance, a condition known to be associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular diseases. Additionally, MSG could disrupt the gut microbiota, potentially affecting cholesterol metabolism. Research teams emphasize that further studies are needed to better understand this mechanism of toxicity.\n\nMoreover, MSG is thought to stimulate appetite, leading to increased food intake. At high doses, it may therefore contribute to weight gain and obesity. This effect could be due to MSG\u2019s potential role in causing leptin resistance, which impairs the hormone responsible for satiety. A study on dietary habits conducted in China in 2008 also indicates that MSG may be associated with an increased risk of overweight, regardless of participants' physical activity and total energy intake.\n\nIn addition, MSG may trigger one or more symptoms in sensitive individuals, including nausea, vomiting, migraines, skin flushing, burning sensations, and hot flashes. Several studies have noted that some participants experienced these symptoms after consuming high doses of MSG. However, the mechanism underlying these symptoms remains unknown. According to a 2017 report by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), current consumption habits particularly expose sensitive children and adolescents, as well as high consumers of this additive, to these risks.\n\nMSG is also suspected of contributing to the onset of several diseases, including type 2 diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases (such as Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s), and autoimmune diseases like multiple sclerosis. Some studies further suggest that MSG may have neurotoxic effects and could impair physical abilities. Researchers, however, indicate that new studies are necessary, particularly those following recent testing protocols, to confirm these suspicions in humans.\n\nIn the United States, MSG has been classified as \u201cGenerally Recognized as Safe\u201d (GRAS) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) since 1980 and is not subject to any specific usage limitations in food products. Since this authorization, no re-evaluation has been conducted to take recent studies on this additive into account.\"",

      "\"E249_long_description\" : \"Nitrites are preservatives extensively used in the food industry, particularly in processed meat products. These additives are added to meat products to extend shelf life, maintain color, and enhance flavor. However, nitrites have been associated with various toxic effects on human health.\n\nWhen added to meat, nitrites can form a group of compounds known as nitrosamines, some of which are classified as \u201cprobably carcinogenic to humans\u201d by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and as genotoxic (capable of altering cellular DNA) by the French National Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health Safety (ANSES). In 2010, IARC also classified nitrites as \u201cprobably carcinogenic to humans\u201d (Group 2A) when ingested under conditions favorable to the formation of nitrosamines. The 2023 report by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) stated that exposure to nitrosamines in food, particularly meat products, \u201craises a public health concern\u201d. It concluded that all age groups are affected by a significant exceedance of safe levels and the increased risk of developing cancer. \n\nAccording to the 2017 EFSA report, studies have shown some evidence linking the combination of nitrite plus nitrate from processed meat and colorectal cancer. A positive association between the dietary intake of nitrites and gastric cancer risk was also suggested. In its 2022 report, ANSES confirmed a positive association between exposure to nitrates and/or nitrites and the risk of colorectal cancer. A suspected correlation was also observed with other types of cancer (breast, bladder, pancreatic, stomach, esophageal, prostate), as well as an increased risk of cancer mortality.\n\nFurthermore, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), nitrites can convert the hemoglobin in blood into methemoglobin, causing a condition known as methemoglobinemia, which impairs the ability of red blood cells to deliver oxygen throughout the body. The WHO also states that infants and the elderly are at greater risk of developing methemoglobinemia. A 2021 publication goes as far as to affirm that nitrites used as preservatives in foods are potential \u201ctriggering agents\u201d for this disease. Other susceptible individuals include adults with a genetic predisposition, those suffering from peptic ulcers, chronic gastritis or renal failure, and dialysis patients.\n\nThe JECFA (Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives) established an acceptable daily intake (ADI) in 2002 to avoid the risk of adverse effects on the blood and also reported that \u201ceffects on the heart and lungs\u201d had been observed in rats.\n\nIn 2017, the EFSA stated that certain consumers are at risk of exceeding the ADI established in Europe (very close to the limit set by the WHO), which would expose them to a health hazard, but decided to maintain the current ADI. This is even more worrisome considering that the ADI does not fully take account of the risks associated with the formation of nitrosated compounds. \n\nBased on the ANSES recommendations, which called for a reduction in the use of nitrate additives as part of a \u201chealth safety objective\u201d approach, on March 27, 2023, the French government announced an \u201cAction plan to reduce the use of nitrite/nitrate additives in food\u201d. The plan sets out a three-stage trajectory for the reduction or elimination of nitrite/nitrate additives in food.\n\nIn the United States, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has permitted the use of nitrites in meat products since 1906. They were subsequently approved for use in tuna and salmon at maximum doses defined by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). However, these limits are more lenient than European regulations, where allowable levels are 2 to 4 times lower, particularly in meat products.\"",

In particular, vision-related issues have been reported. On the other hand, the EFSA has deemed this additive to be perfectly safe for the general population. Nevertheless, this opinion does not take into account some recent, more incriminating studies regarding emulsifiers. \n\nIn fact, a study by INSERM (the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research) in 2024 found a direct correlation between the consumption of this additive and a heightened risk of premenopausal breast cancer (+44-55%). However, the team in charge of the study noticed certain discrepancies, which means further studies are required at this stage to confirm this correlation.\"",

      "\"E171_long_description\" : \"Titanium dioxide is a mineral composed of oxygen and titanium, used in food for its coloring (white pigment) and opacifying properties.\n\nIt is suspected of being genotoxic, meaning it may cause DNA damage in cells. In its 2021 report, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) stated that titanium dioxide may have the potential to cause DNA breaks and chromosomal damage.\n\nEFSA also noted that titanium dioxide could accumulate in the body, cross the placental barrier, and be transferred to the fetus, requiring particular caution for pregnant women.\n\nA 2017 study concluded that titanium dioxide may disrupt the balance of immune cells in the intestines after one week of exposure and, in the long term, could promote intestinal inflammation and the formation of lesions that may lead to tumors in the colon.\n\nIf inhaled, it has been classified as \u201cpossibly carcinogenic to humans\u201d (Group 2B) by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) since 2006 and as carcinogenic by the State of California. The European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) has classified it as a suspected type 2 carcinogen by inhalation following a request by the French Agency for Food, Environmental, and Occupational Health & Safety (ANSES) to classify it as a type 1B carcinogen. ANSES considers its carcinogenic nature to be confirmed. However, ECHA's classification was recently annulled by the European Union General Court, but this decision is under appeal at the European Court of Justice.\n\nAnother risk associated with this additive concerns the presence of nanoparticles. According to studies conducted from 2012 to 2014, up to 36% of food-grade titanium dioxide particles are nanoparticles (under 100 nanometers). EFSA estimates this figure at 3.2% but notes that data are limited. Nanoparticles, due to their small size, can more easily penetrate the body, are more reactive, potentially toxic, and may accumulate in organs. Their ability to interact differently within the body compared to larger particles is a concern highlighted in multiple studies.\n\nIn 2016, the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) added titanium dioxide to the Community Rolling Action Plan (CORAP), a European procedure for conducting in-depth risk assessments on high-concern substances. This procedure was justified due to potential lung toxicity, organ toxicity, and its potential to cause oxidative stress. The conclusions of this procedure are still pending.\n\nDue to the risks associated with this additive, especially as the risk of genotoxicity cannot be ruled out, EFSA concluded in its 2021 opinion that titanium dioxide could no longer be considered safe for use as a food additive. Following this opinion, France banned titanium dioxide in food in 2020, with the European Union following in 2022.\n\nIn the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) stated in 2024 that it is aware of EFSA\u2019s position but does not identify any concerns regarding the genotoxic potential of titanium dioxide. Its use in food has been permitted as a colorant since 1966, with a limit of 1% in products. The Environmental Defense Fund, a non-governmental organization, has requested a ban on this colorant in the United States. The FDA is currently reviewing this request. In 2024, the State of New York also proposed to ban it starting in January 2025, and this proposal is still under review.\"",

      "\"E960a_long_description\" : \"Steviol glycosides are intense sweeteners made from a South American plant called Stevia rebaudiana. This plant naturally contains a blend of steviol glycosides (primarily stevioside, rebaudioside A, rebaudioside C, and dulcoside A). This combination of glycosides is more than 300 times sweeter than sugar (sucrose) and has no calories. For this reason, this additive is often used as a sugar substitute in so-called \"diet\" products.\n\nIn 2015, the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety (ANSES) found a \"lack of nutritional benefit\" for the consumption of intense sweeteners, including steviol glycosides. Its research demonstrated no effect, whether positive or negative, of intense sweeteners on weight control. The ANSES also recommends studying the possible interactions between body size, consumption of intense sweeteners and weight gain. More broadly, the issue of nutritional risks linked to consumption of sweeteners remains unclear. Moreover, some recent data suggests a link between consumption of sweeteners and weight gain. \n\nIn general, sweeteners may also disturb the intestinal flora and promote metabolic disorders, particularly the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. In addition, a study by the French National Institute for Health and Medical Research (Inserm) demonstrated that diet beverages are associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes.\n\nFinally, two Inserm studies published in 2022 suggest an association between the overall consumption of sweeteners and an increased risk of cancer and cardiovascular disease Steviol glycosides were among the sweeteners studied in these two analyses, through a cumulative consumption with other sweeteners.\n\nE960/E960a is a relatively new additive (approved for use in the European Union since 2011), and more research is needed on its long-term effects. An extension of use was approved by the EFSA in 2015: while acknowledging that only infants in the Netherlands are exposed to doses above the ADI, the EFSA generally considers that the use of E960a does not pose a health risk. It has only recently been learned that steviol glycosides can be metabolized by the intestinal flora; only steviol is absorbed by the intestine, processed in the liver, and eliminated through the urine. The effects of steviol glycosides on the intestinal flora and the possible nutritional risks remain unexplored.\"",

      "\"E310_long_description\" : \"Propyl gallate is an antioxidant used to protect fats in various products such as chips, instant noodles and soups, broths, mueslis, and meat products. In Europe, this additive is banned in foods for babies and young children but permitted with restrictions in other products. It is the only gallate still authorized in the European Union, as octyl and dodecyl gallates were removed from the authorized additives list in 2018.\n\nThe most concerning risk associated with propyl gallate is its potential as an endocrine disruptor. In 2014, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) indicated that two studies conducted in 2006 and 2009 on lab-grown cells provided \u201cstrong evidence\u201d of its endocrine-disrupting potential. However, assessing the human risk was deemed challenging without additional studies on animal models. According to EFSA, if these effects are confirmed in animal studies, then this additive should be classified as an endocrine disruptor for humans.\n\nAnother point of concern regarding this additive is the possible presence of organochlorine contaminants from its manufacturing process. These compounds could accumulate in fatty tissues and potentially lead to long-term toxic effects, such as cancer and reproductive disorders. The risks associated with these contaminants appear to be mitigated in the European Union, as their presence is regulated, unlike in the United States where such restrictions do not exist.\n\nMoreover, a 2019 study showed that at high doses, this additive could disrupt normal development and function of the testes, particularly by affecting hormone production necessary for sperm production, thus posing a potential risk of infertility.\n\nIn addition, propyl gallate may have allergenic and irritating potential. According to three studies cited by EFSA in 2014, it could be linked to cases of contact dermatitis (CD). One of these studies suggested it could specifically cause lip inflammation through lipsticks. Despite these studies\u2019 findings, EFSA\u2019s scientific committee concluded in 2014 that its use as a food additive did not pose a significant risk of allergenicity or hypersensitivity due to the low number of reported CD cases following ingestion. Nevertheless, in 2020, EFSA recognized propyl gallate as a skin and eye irritant and a skin sensitizer when used in animal feed.\n\nThe hazards related to propyl gallate are especially concerning due to its many exposure pathways. It is used not only as a food additive but also in animal feed, packaging, and cosmetics. These multiple exposure pathways may contribute to exceeding the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI), which has been observed in adults and the elderly. The ADI specific to this additive was set in 2014 by EFSA, using a safety margin three times stricter than that often applied to other additives. Yet even with this precaution, cases of exceedance have been observed. According to a 2002 report by the Nordic Working Group on Food Toxicology and Risk Assessment (TemaNord), the daily consumption of 150 g of fats containing this additive at maximum permitted levels could be enough to reach the ADI for a person weighing 60 kg. This corresponds, for example, to approximately two full fast-food meals consisting of a cheeseburger, a large serving of fries, and a muffin or milkshake for dessert.\n\nIn the United States, propyl gallate is part of the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s (FDA) list of \u201cGenerally Recognized as Safe\u201d (GRAS) substances. It was approved by the FDA in 1973, which has not since published any updated opinions reflecting more recent studies on this additive.\"",

      "\"E541_long_description\" : \"Sodium aluminum phosphate, used as baking powder, is a mixture of aluminum and phosphoric acid. In the European Union, its use is strictly limited to a single product category (scones and sponge cakes), which means that it is rarely found in European products. In the United States, it is restricted by quantity limits in certain product categories, such as mass-produced cheeses and certain flours, but it remains prevalent in various products such as pancake mixes, cookies, waffles and cakes (where its use is not restricted) and others.\n\nThis additive contributes to the total dietary intake of aluminum, which is too high for a large part of the population, according to the 2008 scientific opinion of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). Although aluminum is mostly eliminated from the body via the stool when ingested, it can accumulate in various tissues, such as bones, liver, lungs, kidneys, and even the brain.\n\nThis is concerning for several reasons. Firstly, it is associated with potential adverse effects on reproduction and fetal development, according to a 2011 document from the World Health Organization (WHO). In addition, it is suspected of causing DNA damage and increasing the risk of diseases such as multiple sclerosis, asthma, autism, epilepsy, and neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease. Although aluminum levels in each food product are generally below the risk threshold, the accumulation from several sources of daily exposure (food, water, cosmetics) can exceed the recommended limits according to several institutions and agencies such as the WHO and the EFSA.\n\nIn its 2018 opinion, the EFSA noted that the European population's exposure to sodium aluminum phosphates is very low, mainly thanks to regulatory restrictions enacted in 2014 that limited their use to a single category of food products. However, the EFSA has expressed concern that children, as well as heavy consumers of aluminum-containing products, may be exceeding the tolerable weekly intake (TWI) of aluminum. It therefore recommended a global assessment of aluminum exposure from all food additives to better manage health risks.\n\nThis additive also contains phosphorus, a vital chemical for the body that plays a role in many biological processes. Notably, it is involved in many of the body's biochemical reactions, as well as in bone mineral density. Therefore, a recommended dietary allowance (RDA) has been established for phosphorous. Phosphorous is naturally present in animal-based and plant-based products. However, according to the 2015 opinion of the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety (ANSES), phosphorus intakes in Europe are 2 to 3 times greater than the RDA, primarily due to the widespread use of phosphate food additives and the high consumption of meat and dairy products. National surveys in the United States conducted in 2015-2016 show a similar trend: Americans consume 1.5 to 3 times the RDA of phosphorous, depending on their age group. In addition, scientific reviews from 2013 and 2019 indicate that phosphorus intakes in the United States are underestimated by more than 20%. This underestimation could be exacerbated by the increase in the use of fast-food and away-from-home establishments, where nutritional information is often missing or incomplete.\n \nAccording to several studies conducted between 2012 and 2023, excessive dietary phosphorus intake can cause many health problems. In particular, it is considered harmful to the kidneys, and those suffering from kidney disease need to carefully monitor their phosphorus intake. Excess phosphorus in the blood could also disrupt calcium metabolism and bone mineralization, which could lead to osteoporosis. It is also suspected of promoting vascular calcification, which is associated with increased cardiovascular mortality. In addition, phosphates from inorganic food additives are more easily absorbed and may have more adverse effects on cardiovascular health than those naturally present in food.\n\nIn the USA, the additive is one of the substances that are \"generally recognized as safe\" (GRAS) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).No re-evaluation has been conducted since it was authorized in 1975 to account for recent studies on the additive.\"",

      "\"E251_long_description\" : \"Nitrates are preservatives extensively used in the food industry, particularly in processed meats. These additives are added to meat products to extend shelf life, maintain color, and enhance flavor. They are also used to prevent certain cheeses from bloating during fermentation.\n\nNitrates can be converted into nitrites in food during storage, or in the mouth or stomach of humans after ingestion. This is concerning as nitrites have been associated with various toxic effects on human health.\n\nWhen added to meat, nitrites can form a group of compounds known as nitrosamines, some of which are classified as \u201cprobably carcinogenic to humans\u201d by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and as genotoxic (capable of altering cellular DNA) by the French National Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health Safety (ANSES). In 2010, IARC also classified nitrites as \u201cprobably carcinogenic to humans\u201d (Group 2A) when ingested under conditions favorable to the formation of nitrosamines. The 2023 report by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) stated that exposure to nitrosamines in food, particularly meat products, \u201craises a public health concern\u201d. It concluded that all age groups are affected by a significant exceedance of safe levels and the increased risk of developing cancer. \n\nAccording to the 2017 EFSA report, studies have shown some evidence linking the combination of nitrite plus nitrate from processed meat and colorectal cancer. A positive association between the dietary intake of nitrites and gastric cancer risk was also suggested. In its 2022 report, ANSES confirmed a positive association between exposure to nitrates and/or nitrites and the risk of colorectal cancer. A suspected correlation was also observed with other types of cancer (breast, bladder, pancreatic, stomach, esophageal, prostate), as well as an increased risk of cancer mortality.\n\n\nFurthermore, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), nitrites can convert the hemoglobin in blood into methemoglobin, causing a condition known as methemoglobinemia, which impairs the ability of red blood cells to deliver oxygen throughout the body. The WHO also states that infants and the elderly are at greater risk of developing methemoglobinemia. A 2021 publication goes as far as to affirm that nitrites used as preservatives in foods are potential \u201ctriggering agents\u201d for this disease. Other susceptible individuals include adults with a genetic predisposition, those suffering from peptic ulcers, chronic gastritis or renal failure, and dialysis patients.\n\nThe JECFA (Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives) established an acceptable daily intake (ADI) in 2002 to avoid the risk of effects on the blood and also reported that effects on the heart and lungs\u201d had been observed in rats.\n\nIn 2017, the EFSA stated that certain consumers are at risk of exceeding the ADI established in Europe (very close to the limit set by the WHO), which would expose them to a health hazard, but decided to maintain the current ADI. This is even more worrisome considering that the ADI does not fully take account of the risks associated with the formation of nitrosated compounds. \n\nThis risk of exceeding the ADI is attributable to several factors: the use of nitrites and nitrates as additives in foodstuffs; the fact that they occur naturally in certain vegetables (particularly spinach and lettuce) and in water. The presence of nitrates in water is due to their use in intensive farming methods, livestock production, and wastewater discharge.\n\nBased on the ANSES recommendations, which called for a reduction in the use of nitrate additives as part of a \u201chealth safety objective\u201d approach, on March 27, 2023, the French government announced an \u201cAction plan to reduce the use of nitrite/nitrate additives in food\u201d. The plan sets out a three-stage trajectory for the reduction or elimination of nitrite/nitrate additives in food.\n\nIn the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has permitted the use of nitrites in salmon and meat products at defined maximum levels since 1977. However, these limits are more lenient than European regulations, where allowable levels are 3 to 5 times lower, particularly in meat products.\"",

      "\"E435_long_description\" : \"Polysorbates are artificial additives made from sorbitol. They are used as emulsifiers to mix normally immiscible substances (such as water and oil), and as stabilizers to prevent the formation of deposits. They are found in salad dressings, ice creams, broths, and coconut milks and creams.\n\nDuring its reevaluation of polysorbates in 2015, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) indicated that the data available at the time was insufficient to assess actual exposure to these additives, but that certain population groups (in particular, young children) risked exceeding the acceptable daily intake (ADI) for this group of additives. Nevertheless, the EFSA ruled out risks related to genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, and reproductive toxicity. It acknowledged the existence of incriminating data with regard to intestinal microbiota, but did not formally take this data into account in its risk assessment. Ultimately, the EFSA recommended that the maximum limits for the impurities of toxic elements (such as lead, mercury, and arsenic) be revised to ensure that polysorbates do not represent a significant source of exposure to these toxic elements.\n\nBetween 2015 and 2024 (since the EFSA evaluation), emulsifiers have been the subject of several studies highlighting their potentially harmful effects, particularly on the gut. These studies suggest that emulsifiers can disrupt the gut microbiota, leading to chronic inflammation that can contribute to the development of chronic diseases such as obesity, type II diabetes, cancer, and inflammatory bowel disease. A 2020 study showed that polysorbate 80 may increase intestinal permeability, allowing harmful substances and pathogens to enter the body more easily and thereby increasing vulnerability to toxins and infections. More recently, in 2023, a study showed that polysorbate 80 may inhibit the growth of probiotics, bacteria that are essential to the proper functioning of the gut, all the while promoting harmful bacteria that may cause relapses in people suffering from Crohn's disease.\n\nIn 2024, a study by the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM) examined the potential link between polysorbate 80 consumption and the risk of cancer. Although the results showed no direct link, the researchers did highlight one major limitation: the subjects consumed much less polysorbate 80 than those observed in other studies. This difference could explain why the study established no direct link. The study also raised a wider concern: people consuming large quantities of emulsifiers in general could be exposed to an increased risk of cancer.\n \nIn the USA, polysorbate 80 was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1978, albeit with specific manufacturing specifications and concentration limits depending on the type of use. Despite the concerns raised by recent research, the FDA has not changed its rules on this additive since providing its initial approval.\"",

      "\"E475_long_description\" : \"Polyglycerol esters of fatty acids (PGEs) are emulsifiers that allow for the creation of an emulsion between two liquids that do not normally mix (such as water and oil). They are present in various products, often popular with children, such as cookies, breakfast cereals, cakes, and dessert creams.\n\nOne of the main risks associated with this additive concerns the potential presence of several dangerous contaminants. These contaminants can appear during the manufacturing process or come from the raw materials used. Among these contaminants is 3-MCPD, a nephrotoxic compound (toxic to the kidneys) classified as \u201cpossibly carcinogenic to humans\u201d (Group 2B) by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). Glycidol, in turn, is considered \u201cprobably carcinogenic\u201d (Group 2A) by the IARC and potentially genotoxic (toxic to the genome). Erucic acid, also concerning, could have harmful effects on heart health and child development. Other worrisome substances include acrolein, which is toxic to the respiratory tract, and epichlorohydrin, classified as \u201cprobably carcinogenic\u201d (Group 2A) by the IARC and known for its irritant properties. Although EFSA has assessed that the reported use levels of this additive do not pose a risk, it has recommended stricter limitations on the presence of these contaminants.\n\nEFSA also evaluated contamination by heavy metals, such as arsenic, lead, mercury, and cadmium. Exposure to arsenic raised concerns, as it approaches levels where adverse health effects may occur. While other heavy metals did not raise concerns, EFSA has recommended a general reduction in the limits for these four heavy metals.\n\nEFSA's recommendations led to an update in European regulations in June 2023, imposing stricter maximum limits on contaminants in this additive and restrictions on the raw materials used in its production. However, these new requirements apply only within the European Union, leaving open the possibility that higher concentrations of contaminants could be present in products outside of Europe.\n\nThese contaminants are especially concerning due to the risk of exceeding the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI), particularly in children. In 2017, EFSA revealed that children regularly consuming foods containing PGEs could exceed the ADI up to five times when these additives are used at the maximum permitted limits.\n\nFinally, studies published between 2011 and 2024 highlight a potential danger of emulsifiers in general: their effects on gut health. These studies suggest that emulsifiers may alter intestinal permeability and disrupt the gut microbiota, potentially promoting inflammation and contributing to an increased risk of numerous chronic diseases, including autoimmune diseases (such as Crohn\u2019s disease), allergies, metabolic syndrome, and even cancer.\n\nFurthermore, a 2024 study by the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM) suggests an association between high consumption of this additive and a 50% increase in the risk of breast cancer. However, uncertainties were noted by the research team leading the study, so additional studies are needed at this stage to confirm this correlation.\n\nOne factor that amplifies these risks is children's brand loyalty to certain products, such as cakes and breakfast cereals, which often contain this additive. This loyalty could increase exposure to PGEs up to tenfold, a factor that EFSA ultimately did not account for in its exposure assessment. In 2017, EFSA based its analysis on a very moderate exposure scenario, leading it to conclude that this additive posed no risk at current usage levels. It also suggested that the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) set by the WHO in 1978 was no longer necessary.\n\nHowever, in 2024, the WHO reaffirmed that this ADI remains applicable for PGEs, thereby contradicting EFSA\u2019s position from 2017, reiterated in 2022.\n\nIn the United States, PGEs are among the substances \u201cGenerally Recognized as Safe\u201d (GRAS) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a substance used in the production of food flavorings. They are authorized as emulsifiers and clarifying agents but must be derived from oils meeting defined regulatory standards, and the amount used must not exceed what is necessary to achieve the desired effect. They may also be used as anti-foaming agents in caramel colors.\"",

      "\"E341iii_long_description\" : \"Phosphates have several functions: leavening agents, stabilizers, acidity regulators, and humectants. Many types of food contain phosphates, including baked goods, processed meat, and dairy products.\n\nPhosphates contain phosphorus, a chemical element essential for many biological processes. Notably, it is involved in many of the body's biochemical reactions, as well as in bone mineral density. Therefore, a recommended dietary allowance (RDA) has been established for phosphorous. Phosphorous is naturally present in animal-based and plant-based products. However, according to the 2015 opinion of the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety. (ANSES), phosphorus intakes in Europe are 2 to 3 times greater than the RDA, primarily due to the widespread use of phosphate food additives and the high consumption of meat and dairy products. National surveys in the United States conducted from 2015-2016 show a similar trend: Americans consume 1.5 to 3 times the RDA of phosphorous, depending on their age group. In addition, scientific reviews from 2013 and 2019 indicate that phosphorus intakes in the United States are underestimated by more than 20% in nutrition databases. This underestimation could be exacerbated by the increase in the use of fast-food and away-from-home establishments, where nutritional information is often missing or incomplete. \n\nAccording to several studies conducted between 2012 and 2023, excessive dietary phosphorus intake can cause many health problems. It may be directly harmful to the kidneys because when the kidneys' capacity to filter out excess phosphorus is exceeded, it can accumulate in the blood. Therefore, people with kidney disease need to carefully monitor their phosphorus intake. Excess phosphorus in the blood could also disrupt calcium metabolism and bone mineralization, which could lead to osteoporosis. It is also suspected of promoting vascular calcification, which is highly associated with increased cardiovascular mortality. In addition, phosphates from inorganic food additives are more easily absorbed and may have more adverse effects on cardiovascular health than those naturally present in food.\n\nStudies conducted in 2023 and 2024 by the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM) also suggest direct associations between high intakes of some phosphate additives (like potassium phosphate, sodium phosphate, and diphosphates) and an increased risk of certain chronic diseases. However, INSERM concluded that further research is required to confirm these correlations.\n\nIn 2019, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) determined that phosphate intake could exceed the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) in infants, children, and adolescents with a high phosphate diet. In addition, vulnerable patients with kidney disease, which affects 10% of the general population, may not be able to tolerate the ADI. EFSA also concluded that current evidence was insufficient to establish a clear link between excess dietary phosphorus and cardiovascular disease and therefore, further studies were recommended. It is important to note that this opinion does not consider the previously mentioned 2024 Inserm study, which provides new perspectives. \n\nAnother source of concern is its presence in the form of nanoparticles, which, because of their small size, can penetrate the body more easily. They are also more reactive, potentially toxic and can accumulate in different organs. Their ability to interact differently with the body compared to larger particles is a concern that has been highlighted by several studies. In 2020, ANSES warned that calcium and magnesium phosphates in nanoparticle form could be present in certain products, notably infant formula, and commercially produced cakes and cookies.\"",

      "\"E321_long_description\" : \"Butylated Hydroxytoluene (BHT) is an antioxidant used to prevent fat rancidity and limit the alteration of flavors and colorants.\n\nAccording to several studies conducted between 2018 and 2023, BHT may act as an endocrine disruptor, notably affecting thyroid function and impacting sex hormones. Special attention should be paid to pregnant women and young children, as BHT may transfer through the placenta or breast milk. It could lead to growth delays and behavioral issues in children.\n\nIn a 2016 opinion, the French Agency for Food, Environmental, and Occupational Health & Safety (ANSES) highlighted numerous uncertainties regarding reproductive toxicity and neurotoxicity in sensitive populations. It subsequently recommended that BHT be added to the Community Rolling Action Plan (CORAP), a European procedure for conducting more in-depth risk assessments for highly concerning substances. This evaluation is still ongoing. Additionally, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the World Health Organization (WHO) noted effects on reproduction, development, and the thyroid in their 2012 and 1995 reviews, though they did not, at the time, link these effects to potential endocrine disruption.\n\nBHT may also affect the proper functioning of various organs following long-term exposure, particularly the liver, kidneys, lungs, blood, and nervous system. A 2018 study even suggested that BHT could act as a \u201cpotential tumor promoter.\u201d However, in its 2012 review, EFSA noted that this tumor-promoting effect only occurs beyond a certain threshold, one that is significantly higher than exposure levels through food ingestion containing this additive.\n\nIn the same 2012 review, EFSA raised the acceptable daily intake (ADI) level. Nonetheless, EFSA estimates that average BHT consumption among children could exceed this new threshold of health concern, due to its use as an additive and its presence in certain plastic food packaging. However, the agency made no recommendations to limit this exposure in children, despite concerns over this age group\u2019s particular sensitivity to the previously mentioned effects, including endocrine disruption.\n\nIn the United States, BHT is classified as \u201cGenerally Recognized as Safe\u201d (GRAS) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), but its use and dosage are limited according to product categories. BHT was approved in 1973 by the FDA, which has not issued a new review since then to consider more recent studies on this additive.\"",

The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) thus acknowledges, in its 2015 re-evaluation, that residual proteins from the extraction process may trigger allergies (asthma attacks, urticaria, edema, etc.) in susceptible individuals. It recommends that manufacturers reduce residual protein content as much as possible by adding purification steps to the manufacturing process. \n\nThe EFSA also supports labeling to inform consumers of the presence of this dye in products and the related risk of allergen exposure for susceptible individuals.\n\nMoreover, the EFSA recommends that this additive's specifications should be revised with regard to upper limits of metal content (arsenic, mercury, cadmium, and lead) to ensure that the additive is not a source of exposure.\n\nHowever, the EFSA dismisses concerns about risks of carcinogenicity, genotoxicity, or reproductive toxicity.\"",

They are found in bakery products, processed meats, dairy products, among others.\n\nPhosphates contain phosphorus, a chemical element essential for the body, involved in numerous biochemical reactions and in bone mineral mass. Therefore, there is a recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for phosphorus. It is naturally present in animal and plant products. However, according to a 2015 opinion by the French Agency for Food, Environmental, and Occupational Health & Safety (ANSES), phosphorus intake in Europe exceeds the RDA by 2 to 3 times, mainly due to the consumption of phosphate additives and high consumption of meat and dairy products. National surveys in the United States from 2015-2016 show a similar trend: Americans exceed recommended phosphorus levels by 1.5 to 3 times, depending on age group. Moreover, scientific reviews from 2013 and 2019 highlight that phosphorus intake in the U.S. is underestimated by more than 20% in nutritional databases. This underestimation may be worsened by the rise of fast food and out-of-home meals, where nutritional information is often missing or incomplete.\n\nAccording to several studies conducted between 2012 and 2023, excess phosphorus could have various problematic effects. It is notably detrimental to the kidneys: when the kidneys\u2019 capacity to eliminate it is exceeded, phosphorus can accumulate in the blood. Individuals with kidney disease must be particularly cautious. Excess phosphorus in the blood would disrupt calcium metabolism and bone mineralization, potentially leading to osteoporosis. It is also suspected to cause vascular calcification, which may be associated with higher cardiovascular mortality. Additionally, phosphates from food additives are more easily absorbed and may have more detrimental effects on cardiovascular health than those naturally present in foods.\n\nStudies conducted in 2023 and 2024 by the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM) also suggest a link between high consumption of certain phosphate additives and increased risks of certain chronic diseases. These studies observed a 45% increase in premenopausal breast cancer risk for diphosphates and a 77% increase for potassium phosphate, a 15% increase in type 2 diabetes risk for potassium phosphate, and a 6% increase in coronary heart disease risk for sodium phosphate. However, INSERM states that further research is needed to confirm these correlations.\n\nThe European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) estimated in 2019 that phosphate intake could exceed the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) for infants, children, and adolescents with a diet high in phosphates. Additionally, people with kidney disease, estimated to be 10% of the population, may not tolerate the ADI due to their vulnerability. EFSA also concluded that current evidence is insufficient to establish a clear link between excess dietary phosphorus and cardiovascular diseases and recommended further studies. It is important to note that this opinion does not take into account the aforementioned 2024 INSERM study, which offers new perspectives.\nIn the United States, phosphate additives have been recognized as \u201cgenerally recognized as safe\u201d (GRAS) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) since the 1970s. According to U.S. regulations, their use is limited in certain product categories: industrial cheeses and acidified milks, bakery products, ice cream, jams, and cocoa-based products. For other product categories, there is no maximum amount to be adhered to.\n\nBetween 2014 and 2016, several initiatives were launched in the U.S. to urge the FDA to mandate phosphorus content labeling on products. Organizations such as the American Society of Nephrology and the National Kidney Foundation led various actions to demand such labeling, to no avail so far.\"",

      "\"E319_long_description\" : \"TBHQ (tert-butylhydroquinone) is a petroleum-derived compound used as an antioxidant for fats present in many processed foods, including fried products, snacks, and ready-to-eat meals. Its purpose is to prevent fat oxidation, thereby stopping foods from becoming rancid.\n\nFirstly, TBHQ is suspected of being carcinogenic. A scientific review of several studies published in 2022 concluded that prolonged exposure to high doses of TBHQ could contribute to cancer development through various mechanisms: activating inflammatory pathways, generating harmful substances, stimulating enzymes that may produce toxins, disrupting cellular processes, and reducing the levels of molecules essential for cell protection and energy.\n\nFurthermore, this additive belongs to the same chemical family as BHT and BHA, the latter being classified as \u201cpossibly carcinogenic to humans\u201d (Group 2B) by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). However, during its 2004 assessment, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) concluded that TBHQ was not carcinogenic.\n\nMoreover, studies conducted between 2017 and 2023 have revealed that this additive, at high doses, could have harmful effects on the immune system and increase vulnerability to infections such as the flu. A 2017 study particularly highlighted its potential impact on children, whose immune systems are still developing. Another study from 2023 also suggested effects on genes involved in immune response. This study additionally examined its impact on the pancreas, noting significant effects such as reduced growth, survival, and pancreatic development.\n\nThese effects are especially concerning given the risk of exceeding the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) for children who are heavy consumers of products containing this additive when used at the maximum permitted levels, according to the EFSA. In its 2016 exposure assessment of this additive, the EFSA scientific committee also indicated that the presence of TBHQ might be underestimated. TBHQ could be present in a product without being listed on the label if it is already present in one of the ingredients before manufacturing. The EFSA also pointed out a lack of data on the use and concentrations of TBHQ in certain food categories, which led to the exclusion of these categories from the exposure assessment. Despite these two sources of underestimation, the committee considered them not significant enough to challenge TBHQ's safety.\n\nIn the United States, TBHQ has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) since 1977 as an antioxidant (either alone or in combination with others) as long as the total antioxidant content in the finished product does not exceed 0.02% of its fat content.\"",

Unlike intense sweeteners, bulk sweeteners have less sweetening power than sugar (sucrose). Sorbitol is naturally present in certain fruits and has half the sweetening power of sugar (sucrose). In the industry, it is derived from starch (most often corn starch). It can also be used for its texture properties, to thicken or stabilize products. Moreover, sorbitol is found naturally in apples, pears, peaches, and apricots.\n\nIn the event of heavy consumption, sorbitol may cause digestive issues (diarrhea, bloating, flatulence). As a result, foodstuffs containing more than 10% sorbitol must bear the statement, \"Excess consumption may have a laxative effect.\" Moreover, sorbitol is prohibited for use in beverages and baby products.\n\nGenerally speaking, sweeteners may also disrupt the intestinal flora and promote metabolic disorders, particularly the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Although sorbitol and other bulk sweeteners lead to a better glycemic response than sugar, few studies have been conducted on their impact on the intestinal flora, weight gain, or the risk of type 2 diabetes.\n\nThe European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has planned to re-evaluate bulk and intense sweeteners by December 2020. In connection with this, it launched appeals for toxicological (2017) and compositional data (2018) from the industry. Sorbitol will be re-evaluated in light of these new data.\"",

      "\"E343_long_description\" : \"Phosphates have several functions: leavening agents, stabilizers, acidity regulators, and humectants. Many types of food contain phosphates, including baked goods, processed meat, and dairy products.\n\nPhosphates contain phosphorus, a chemical element essential for many biological processes. Notably, it is involved in many of the body's biochemical reactions, as well as in bone mineral density. Therefore, a recommended dietary allowance (RDA) has been established for phosphorous. Phosphorous is naturally present in animal-based and plant-based products. However, according to the 2015 opinion of the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety. (ANSES), phosphorus intakes in Europe are 2 to 3 times greater than the RDA, primarily due to the widespread use of phosphate food additives and the high consumption of meat and dairy products. National surveys in the United States conducted from 2015-2016 show a similar trend: Americans consume 1.5 to 3 times the RDA of phosphorous, depending on their age group. In addition, scientific reviews from 2013 and 2019 indicate that phosphorus intakes in the United States are underestimated by more than 20% in nutrition databases. This underestimation could be exacerbated by the increase in the use of fast-food and away-from-home establishments, where nutritional information is often missing or incomplete. \n\nAccording to several studies conducted between 2012 and 2023, excessive dietary phosphorus intake can cause many health problems. It may be directly harmful to the kidneys because when the kidneys' capacity to filter out excess phosphorus is exceeded, it can accumulate in the blood. Therefore, people with kidney disease need to carefully monitor their phosphorus intake. Excess phosphorus in the blood could also disrupt calcium metabolism and bone mineralization, which could lead to osteoporosis. It is also suspected of promoting vascular calcification, which is highly associated with increased cardiovascular mortality. In addition, phosphates from inorganic food additives are more easily absorbed and may have more adverse effects on cardiovascular health than those naturally present in food.\n\nStudies conducted in 2023 and 2024 by the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM) also suggest direct associations between high intakes of some phosphate additives (like potassium phosphate, sodium phosphate, and diphosphates) and an increased risk of certain chronic diseases. However, INSERM concluded that further research is required to confirm these correlations.\n\nIn 2019, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) determined that phosphate intake could exceed the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) in infants, children, and adolescents with a high phosphate diet. In addition, vulnerable patients with kidney disease, which affects 10% of the general population, may not be able to tolerate the ADI. EFSA also concluded that current evidence was insufficient to establish a clear link between excess dietary phosphorus and cardiovascular disease and therefore, further studies were recommended. It is important to note that this opinion does not consider the previously mentioned 2024 Inserm study, which provides new perspectives. \n\nAnother source of concern is its presence in the form of nanoparticles, which, because of their small size, can penetrate the body more easily. They are also more reactive, potentially toxic and can accumulate in different organs. Their ability to interact differently with the body compared to larger particles is a concern that has been highlighted by several studies. In 2020, ANSES warned that calcium and magnesium phosphates in nanoparticle form could be present in certain products, notably infant formula, and commercially produced cakes and cookies.\"",
      "\"E466_long_description\" : \"Sodium carboxymethylcellulose (or cellulose gum) is an additive that can have multiple uses, including as an emulsifier, thickener, setting agent, glazing agent, and stabilizer. However, it is classified as an emulsifier. Emulsifiers make it possible to create an emulsion of two liquids that do not mix (oil and water, for example).\n\nIn its 2018 re-evaluation, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) deemed that this additive provided no cause for concern and that the available data did not point to any risk of genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, or reproductive toxicity. However, that opinion does not take into account some recent, incriminating studies regarding emulsifiers.\n\nIn 2023, a study by INSERM (the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research) found that higher intakes of cellulose (in particular, cellulose gum) can lead to a heightened risk of cardiovascular disease (up to +7%). Further studies are required to confirm this finding.\n\nMoreover, the EFSA did not study digestive upset or the risks of increased intestinal permeability or changes to intestinal flora, concerns raised by recent animal studies.\n\nIndeed, some studies suggest that emulsifiers modify intestinal permeability, causing intestinal barrier dysfunction. They may thus increase the risk of auto-immune disorders (such as Crohn's disease) and allergies.\n\nOther studies suggest that emulsifiers may disrupt the intestinal flora and promote inflammation, increasing the risk of inflammatory diseases and metabolic syndrome. Inflammation resulting from modification of the flora by emulsifiers may even promote the development of colon cancer, according to a recent study (Viennois, 2017).\n\nMoreover, EFSA experts have requested a review of the specifications pertaining to this additive (heavy metal and solvent residue levels, etc.). Indeed, the Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources Added to Food (ANS) noted gaps in the conclusions and recommendations in opinions published in 2018 (regarding heavy metal levels, for example).\n\nFollowing a call for data by the European Commission, the industry has yet to provide a proposal for the lowest achievable level for heavy metal residues, and recommends that the maximum residue levels for this additive not be lowered. In a report from 2022, the EFSA declared that it does not agree with the arguments put forward by the industry.\"",

In the European Union, its use is strictly limited to a single product category (scones and sponge cakes), which means that it is rarely found in European products. In the United States, it is restricted by quantity limits in certain product categories, such as mass-produced cheeses and certain flours, but it remains prevalent in various products such as pancake mixes, cookies, waffles and cakes (where its use is not restricted) and others.\n\nThis additive contributes to the total dietary intake of aluminum, which is too high for a large part of the population, according to the 2008 scientific opinion of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). Although aluminum is mostly eliminated from the body via the stool when ingested, it can accumulate in various tissues, such as bones, liver, lungs, kidneys, and even the brain.\n\nThis is concerning for several reasons. Firstly, it is associated with potential adverse effects on reproduction and fetal development, according to a 2011 document from the World Health Organization (WHO). In addition, it is suspected of causing DNA damage and increasing the risk of diseases such as multiple sclerosis, asthma, autism, epilepsy, and neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease. Although aluminum levels in each food product are generally below the risk threshold, the accumulation from several sources of daily exposure (food, water, cosmetics) can exceed the recommended limits according to several institutions and agencies such as the WHO and the EFSA.\n\nIn its 2018 opinion, the EFSA noted that the European population's exposure to sodium aluminum phosphates is very low, mainly thanks to regulatory restrictions enacted in 2014 that limited their use to a single category of food products. However, the EFSA has expressed concern that children, as well as heavy consumers of aluminum-containing products, may be exceeding the tolerable weekly intake (TWI) of aluminum. It therefore recommended a global assessment of aluminum exposure from all food additives to better manage health risks.\n\nThis additive also contains phosphorus, a vital chemical for the body that plays a role in many biological processes. Notably, it is involved in many of the body's biochemical reactions, as well as in bone mineral density. Therefore, a recommended dietary allowance (RDA) has been established for phosphorous. Phosphorous is naturally present in animal-based and plant-based products. However, according to the 2015 opinion of the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety (ANSES), phosphorus intakes in Europe are 2 to 3 times greater than the RDA, primarily due to the widespread use of phosphate food additives and the high consumption of meat and dairy products.

Excess phosphorus in the blood could also disrupt calcium metabolism and bone mineralization, which could lead to osteoporosis. It is also suspected of promoting vascular calcification, which is associated with increased cardiovascular mortality. In addition, phosphates from inorganic food additives are more easily absorbed and may have more adverse effects on cardiovascular health than those naturally present in food.\n\nIn the USA, the additive is one of the substances that are \"generally recognized as safe\" (GRAS) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).No re-evaluation has been conducted since it was authorized in 1975 to account for recent studies on the additive.\"",

      "\"E452iii_long_description\" : \"Phosphates have several functions: leavening agents, stabilizers, acidity regulators, and humectants. Many types of food contain phosphates, including baked goods, processed meat, and dairy products.\n\nPhosphates contain phosphorus, a chemical element essential for many biological processes. Notably, it is involved in many of the body's biochemical reactions, as well as in bone mineral density. Therefore, a recommended dietary allowance (RDA) has been established for phosphorous. Phosphorus is naturally present in animal-based and plant-based products. However, according to the 2015 opinion of the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety. (ANSES), phosphorus intakes in Europe are 2 to 3 times greater than the RDA, primarily due to the widespread use of phosphate food additives and the high consumption of meat and dairy products. National surveys in the United States conducted from 2015-2016 show a similar trend: Americans consume 1.5 to 3 times the RDA of phosphorous, depending on their age group. In addition, scientific reviews from 2013 and 2019 indicate that phosphorus intakes in the United States are underestimated by more than 20% in nutrition databases. This underestimation could be exacerbated by the increase in the use of fast-food and away-from-home establishments, where nutritional information is often missing or incomplete. \n\nAccording to several studies conducted between 2012 and 2023, excessive dietary phosphorus intake can cause many health problems. It may be directly harmful to the kidneys because when the kidneys' capacity to filter out excess phosphorus is exceeded, it can accumulate in the blood. Therefore, people with kidney disease need to carefully monitor their phosphorus intake. Excess phosphorus in the blood could also disrupt calcium metabolism and bone mineralization, which could lead to osteoporosis. It is also suspected of promoting vascular calcification, which is associated with increased cardiovascular mortality. In addition, phosphates from inorganic food additives are more easily absorbed and may have more adverse effects on cardiovascular health than those naturally present in food.\n\nStudies conducted in 2023 and 2024 by the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM) also suggest direct associations between high intakes of some phosphate additives and an increased risk of some chronic diseases. These studies observed a 77% increase in the risk of breast cancer (in premenopausal women) for diphosphates, a 15% increase in the risk of type 2 diabetes for potassium phosphate, and a 6% increase in the risk of coronary heart disease for sodium phosphate. However, INSERM concluded that further research is required to confirm these correlations.\n\nIn 2019, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) determined that phosphate intake could exceed the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) in infants, children, and adolescents with a high phosphate diet. In addition, vulnerable patients with kidney disease, which affects 10% of the general population, may not be able to tolerate the ADI. EFSA also concluded that current evidence was insufficient to establish a clear link between excess dietary phosphorus and cardiovascular disease and therefore, further studies were recommended. It is important to note that this opinion does not consider the previously mentioned 2024 Inserm study, which provides new perspectives. \n\nIn the United States, phosphate additives are substances that have been \u201cgenerally recognized as safe\u201d (GRAS) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) since the 1970s. Under US regulations, their use is limited in certain product categories: industrial and acidified cheeses and milk, baked goods, ice cream, jams, and cocoa products. There is no maximum allowable quantity for the other product categories.\n\nBetween 2014 and 2016, several initiatives were launched in the United States to urge the FDA to require the mandatory listing of phosphorus content on product labels. Organizations such as the American Society of Nephrology and the National Kidney Foundation have taken action to advocate for this labeling, but their efforts have been unsuccessful to date.\"",

Moreover, sorbitol is found naturally in apples, pears, peaches, and apricots.\n\nIn the event of heavy consumption, sorbitol may cause digestive issues (diarrhea, bloating, flatulence).

Although sorbitol and other bulk sweeteners lead to a better glycemic response than sugar, few studies have been conducted on their impact on the intestinal flora, weight gain, or the risk of type 2 diabetes.\n\nThe European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has planned to re-evaluate bulk and intense sweeteners by December 2020. In connection with this, it launched appeals for toxicological (2017) and compositional data (2018) from the industry. Sorbitol will be re-evaluated in light of these new data.\"",

These additives are used in a variety of products \u2014 including baked goods such as baker's yeast, pizza dough, muffins, etc. \u2014 to improve the homogeneity and texture of dough. \n\nIn a study from 2021, this additive was found to affect human gut microbiota, in particular by promoting inflammation and causing a change in the latter's composition. Sorbitan monostearate has also been found to contribute to an increased risk of diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease.\n\nIn our bodies, sorbitan esters are broken down into sorbitol and sorbitol fatty acids. According to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), these by-products are safe: the fatty acids are used by the body, and the sorbitol is eliminated through urine and feces. Nevertheless, a study from 2017 found that a high consumption of products containing sorbitol can lead to digestive problems such as gas, bloating, and diarrhea, in particular due to sorbitol's laxative properties and its intolerance in certain people.\n\nIn 2017, the EFSA ruled out the risk of genotoxicity (a substance's ability to damage DNA), but the effects on gut microbiota were not evaluated due to a lack of studies on the subject at that time. The EFSA underscored the general lack of long-term studies which are required to better assess the chronic effects of this additive. However, it indicated that studies on the acute effects were sufficient to establish an acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 10 mg of sorbitan per day per kg of body weight. \n\nThe EFSA also stressed the need to reduce the current limits for certain toxic elements (arsenic, cadmium, lead, and mercury) present in these additives to avoid excessive dietary exposures.\n\nIn addition, the committee emphasized the lack of data on the types and usage levels of sorbitan esters, as well as analytical data on their actual presence in food products. This lack of data makes assessments of actual consumer exposure to these additives less precise and less realistic. \n\nThis additive is authorized in the United States by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration), and is subject to compliance with precise manufacturing specifications and concentration limits defined according to its use and its combination with other emulsifiers. \n\n\"",

      "\"E968_long_description\" : \"Erythritol (E968) is a very low-calorie natural sweetener commonly used as a sugar substitute. It is also used as a flavor enhancer.\n\nConsuming large quantities of erythritol may cause gastrointestinal disturbances such as diarrhea and gas in some people. This main adverse side effect is common to all polyols, the group of sugar alcohols to which erythritol belongs; it is based on this side effect that different thresholds were successively established within the European Union. Initially, in 2003, the Scientific Committee on Food did not approve the use of E968 in beverages, stating the opinion that the threshold for gastrointestinal disturbances may be exceeded. In 2010, based on new pediatric data on the gastrointestinal tolerability of E968, the EFSA concluded that an incorporation rate above 2.5% in beverages could pose a risk to consumers. In 2015, the EFSA finally approved the use of E968 in non-alcoholic beverages at a maximum usage level of 1.6%, based on new clinical findings. Within the European Union, any product that contains more than 10% of erythritol must bear the following statement: \"Excess consumption may produce laxative effects\".\n\nThus far, erythritol is generally recognized as safe and no ADI (Acceptable Daily Intake) has been established. Two studies have reported isolated adverse reactions following consumption of E968: a pediatric case of anaphylaxis, and an adult case of allergic urticaria.\n\nHowever, a recent study published in February 2023 in the journal Nature Medicine suggests that consuming erythritol may increase the risk of cardiovascular events. High doses of erythritol may increase the risk of blood clots and cardiovascular problems according to the preliminary findings of American researchers. The study also included an in vitro assay to support the mechanisms of action of E968: both studies confirmed that E968 can affect vascular function.\n\nThis was an observational study which found an association between the presence of erythritol and elevated cardiovascular risk but does not prove a cause-and-effect relationship. Moreover, the study has several limitations, including sample biases and methodological inconsistencies. Also, considering that no toxicology studies evaluated by the JECFA, SCF, and EFSA have previously reported such effects, more research is needed to confirm these findings.\"",

      "\"E477_long_description\" : \"Propylene glycol esters of fatty acids (PGEFAs), used as texturizing agents, are found in many products, including ice cream, frozen desserts, and baked goods such as filled cookies, muffins, and cakes.\n\nOne of the main risks associated with this additive concerns the potential presence of several dangerous contaminants. These contaminants can emerge during its production or from the raw materials used. Among these are 3-MCPD esters, which can release 3-MCPD, a nephrotoxic compound (toxic to the kidneys) classified as \u201cpossibly carcinogenic to humans\u201d (Group 2B) by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). This additive could also contribute to the formation of another contaminant, glycidol, which is classified as \u201cprobably carcinogenic\u201d (Group 2A) by the IARC and potentially genotoxic (toxic to the genome). Other concerning contaminants include erucic acid, which may have harmful effects on the heart and lead to growth delays in children. Additionally, this additive may contain other contaminants such as toxic heavy metals (arsenic, lead, cadmium, and mercury). The EU has set maximum concentrations for these heavy metals, but according to EFSA\u2019s 2018 assessment, these limits are too close to safety thresholds. EFSA recommended in 2018 to reduce these contaminants across the board, specifically by lowering heavy metal limits and setting maximum levels for other contaminants. So far, no regulatory changes have been applied in Europe in response to these recommendations, nor have any measures been taken in the United States.\n\nFurthermore, this additive can be derived from hydrogenated fats, which are sources of trans fatty acids, known to increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases.\n\nAdditionally, once ingested, this additive can degrade into propylene glycol. Studies from 2005 and 2014 suggested that propylene glycol is particularly concerning for individuals with kidney disease and infants, who have more difficulty eliminating it. This could lead to accumulation in the blood and result in symptoms of toxicity. In 2018, EFSA proposed evaluating all additives containing propylene glycol together, as evaluating them separately could lead to an underestimation of the risks. However, no further opinions have been published since.\n\nFinally, although EFSA indicated that, at the usage levels reported by manufacturers, the ADI for this additive is not exceeded, it did observe exceedance among young children and toddlers, who are high consumers of products containing this additive when used at maximum permitted levels. This suggests that current limits may not be sufficiently protective for this age group.\n\nIn the United States, this additive was approved in 1977 by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), provided it is derived from oils that meet regulatory standards and used within the amounts necessary to achieve the desired effect. The FDA has not issued a new opinion since that time to reflect more recent studies on this additive.\"",

      "\"E433_long_description\" : \"Polysorbates are artificial additives made from sorbitol. They are used as emulsifiers to mix normally immiscible substances (such as water and oil), and as stabilizers to prevent the formation of deposits. They are found in salad dressings, ice creams, broths, and coconut milks and creams.\n\nDuring its reevaluation of polysorbates in 2015, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) indicated that the data available at the time was insufficient to assess actual exposure to these additives, but that certain population groups (in particular, young children) risked exceeding the acceptable daily intake (ADI) for this group of additives. Nevertheless, the EFSA ruled out risks related to genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, and reproductive toxicity. It acknowledged the existence of incriminating data with regard to intestinal microbiota, but did not formally take this data into account in its risk assessment. Ultimately, the EFSA recommended that the maximum limits for the impurities of toxic elements (such as lead, mercury, and arsenic) be revised to ensure that polysorbates do not represent a significant source of exposure to these toxic elements.\n\nBetween 2015 and 2024 (since the EFSA evaluation), emulsifiers have been the subject of several studies highlighting their potentially harmful effects, particularly on the gut. These studies suggest that emulsifiers can disrupt the gut microbiota, leading to chronic inflammation that can contribute to the development of chronic diseases such as obesity, type II diabetes, cancer, and inflammatory bowel disease. A 2020 study showed that polysorbate 80 may increase intestinal permeability, allowing harmful substances and pathogens to enter the body more easily and thereby increasing vulnerability to toxins and infections. More recently, in 2023, a study showed that polysorbate 80 may inhibit the growth of probiotics, bacteria that are essential to the proper functioning of the gut, all the while promoting harmful bacteria that may cause relapses in people suffering from Crohn's disease.\n\nIn 2024, a study by the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM) examined the potential link between polysorbate 80 consumption and the risk of cancer. Although the results showed no direct link, the researchers did highlight one major limitation: the subjects consumed much less polysorbate 80 than those observed in other studies. This difference could explain why the study established no direct link. The study also raised a wider concern: people consuming large quantities of emulsifiers in general could be exposed to an increased risk of cancer.\n \nIn the USA, polysorbate 80 was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1978, albeit with specific manufacturing specifications and concentration limits depending on the type of use. Despite the concerns raised by recent research, the FDA has not changed its rules on this additive since providing its initial approval.\"",

      "\"E340iii_long_description\" : \"Phosphates have several functions: leavening agents, stabilizers, acidity regulators, and humectants. They are found in bakery products, processed meats, dairy products, among others.\n\nPhosphates contain phosphorus, a chemical element essential for the body, involved in numerous biochemical reactions and in bone mineral mass. Therefore, there is a recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for phosphorus. It is naturally present in animal and plant products. However, according to a 2015 opinion by the French Agency for Food, Environmental, and Occupational Health & Safety (ANSES), phosphorus intake in Europe exceeds the RDA by 2 to 3 times, mainly due to the consumption of phosphate additives and high consumption of meat and dairy products. National surveys in the United States from 2015-2016 show a similar trend: Americans exceed recommended phosphorus levels by 1.5 to 3 times, depending on age group. Moreover, scientific reviews from 2013 and 2019 highlight that phosphorus intake in the U.S. is underestimated by more than 20% in nutritional databases. This underestimation may be worsened by the rise of fast food and out-of-home meals, where nutritional information is often missing or incomplete.\n\nAccording to several studies conducted between 2012 and 2023, excess phosphorus could have various problematic effects. It is notably detrimental to the kidneys: when the kidneys\u2019 capacity to eliminate it is exceeded, phosphorus can accumulate in the blood. Individuals with kidney disease must be particularly cautious. Excess phosphorus in the blood would disrupt calcium metabolism and bone mineralization, potentially leading to osteoporosis. It is also suspected to cause vascular calcification, which may be associated with higher cardiovascular mortality. Additionally, phosphates from food additives are more easily absorbed and may have more detrimental effects on cardiovascular health than those naturally present in foods.\n\nStudies conducted in 2023 and 2024 by the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM) also suggest a link between high consumption of certain phosphate additives and increased risks of certain chronic diseases. These studies observed a 45% increase in premenopausal breast cancer risk for diphosphates and a 77% increase for potassium phosphate, a 15% increase in type 2 diabetes risk for potassium phosphate, and a 6% increase in coronary heart disease risk for sodium phosphate. However, INSERM states that further research is needed to confirm these correlations.\n\nThe European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) estimated in 2019 that phosphate intake could exceed the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) for infants, children, and adolescents with a diet high in phosphates. Additionally, people with kidney disease, estimated to be 10% of the population, may not tolerate the ADI due to their vulnerability. EFSA also concluded that current evidence is insufficient to establish a clear link between excess dietary phosphorus and cardiovascular diseases and recommended further studies. It is important to note that this opinion does not take into account the aforementioned 2024 INSERM study, which offers new perspectives.\nIn the United States, phosphate additives have been recognized as \u201cgenerally recognized as safe\u201d (GRAS) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) since the 1970s. According to U.S. regulations, their use is limited in certain product categories: industrial cheeses and acidified milks, bakery products, ice cream, jams, and cocoa-based products. For other product categories, there is no maximum amount to be adhered to.\n\nBetween 2014 and 2016, several initiatives were launched in the U.S. to urge the FDA to mandate phosphorus content labeling on products. Organizations such as the American Society of Nephrology and the National Kidney Foundation led various actions to demand such labeling, to no avail so far.\"",

      "\"E436_long_description\" : \"Polysorbates are artificial additives made from sorbitol. They are used as emulsifiers to mix normally immiscible substances (such as water and oil), and as stabilizers to prevent the formation of deposits. They are found in salad dressings, ice creams, broths, and coconut milks and creams.\n\nDuring its reevaluation of polysorbates in 2015, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) indicated that the data available at the time was insufficient to assess actual exposure to these additives, but that certain population groups (in particular, young children) risked exceeding the acceptable daily intake (ADI) for this group of additives. Nevertheless, the EFSA ruled out risks related to genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, and reproductive toxicity. It acknowledged the existence of incriminating data with regard to intestinal microbiota, but did not formally take this data into account in its risk assessment. Ultimately, the EFSA recommended that the maximum limits for the impurities of toxic elements (such as lead, mercury, and arsenic) be revised to ensure that polysorbates do not represent a significant source of exposure to these toxic elements.\n\nBetween 2015 and 2024 (since the EFSA evaluation), emulsifiers have been the subject of several studies highlighting their potentially harmful effects, particularly on the gut. These studies suggest that emulsifiers can disrupt the gut microbiota, leading to chronic inflammation that can contribute to the development of chronic diseases such as obesity, type II diabetes, cancer, and inflammatory bowel disease. A 2020 study showed that polysorbate 80 may increase intestinal permeability, allowing harmful substances and pathogens to enter the body more easily and thereby increasing vulnerability to toxins and infections. More recently, in 2023, a study showed that polysorbate 80 may inhibit the growth of probiotics, bacteria that are essential to the proper functioning of the gut, all the while promoting harmful bacteria that may cause relapses in people suffering from Crohn's disease.\n\nIn 2024, a study by the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM) examined the potential link between polysorbate 80 consumption and the risk of cancer. Although the results showed no direct link, the researchers did highlight one major limitation: the subjects consumed much less polysorbate 80 than those observed in other studies. This difference could explain why the study established no direct link. The study also raised a wider concern: people consuming large quantities of emulsifiers in general could be exposed to an increased risk of cancer.\n \nIn the USA, polysorbate 80 was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1978, albeit with specific manufacturing specifications and concentration limits depending on the type of use. Despite the concerns raised by recent research, the FDA has not changed its rules on this additive since providing its initial approval.\"",

      "\"E473_long_description\" : \"Sucrose esters of fatty acids are emulsifiers commonly used in beverages, dairy products, and baked goods to enhance the stability of oil and water mixtures. Additionally, they are applied to the surface of fruits like apples to prolong their shelf life and give them a shiny appearance.\n\nStudies published between 2011 and 2024 highlight a potential risk associated with emulsifiers in general: their effects on gut health. These studies suggest that emulsifiers could alter intestinal permeability and disrupt the gut microbiome. As a result, they may promote inflammation and contribute to an increased risk of various diseases, including autoimmune diseases (such as Crohn's disease), allergies, metabolic syndrome, and cancer. A 2024 study specifically suggests that ingesting sucrose esters of fatty acids may increase intestinal permeability, alter gut microbiome diversity, and lead to dysbiosis (imbalance of gut microbiota). Additionally, this study observed that sucrose esters of fatty acids could induce insulin resistance, affecting the hormone that regulates blood sugar levels.\n\nThis additive may also contain acetaldehyde residues. Acetaldehyde is categorized as \"possibly carcinogenic to humans\" (Group 2B) and as a confirmed carcinogen (Group 1) when consumed with alcohol, according to the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). In the European Union, a maximum limit of 50 ppm (mg/kg) has been set, unlike in the United States, where this component is not regulated.\n\nThe European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) also highlighted in 2023 the risks related to the presence of toxic heavy metals, such as arsenic, mercury, cadmium, and lead, which may be present in this additive. Consequently, EFSA has recommended lowering the maximum allowable limits for these contaminants to minimize health risks. In the United States, limits for arsenic are identical to those in Europe, while limits for lead are five times higher. There are no specific limits for cadmium and mercury.\n\nEFSA has repeatedly assessed the safety of sucrose esters of fatty acids, with ongoing concerns about excessive exposure in certain populations, particularly young children. In 2010, an excess of the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) was observed among adults and children who are high consumers of products containing this additive. The primary exposure source was fresh fruit coated with this additive. For fresh fruit, the additive was authorized under the principle of *quantum satis*, meaning no maximum limit is set, but its use must avoid abuse or excessive application.\n\nIn response, in 2012, industry significantly reduced dosing for fruit treatment, cutting usage by more than 780 times. Despite this reduction, in 2018, EFSA observed ADI exceedances among children, adolescents, and adults who are high consumers of products containing this additive. The 2018 assessment found that exposure levels in children could reach up to three times the ADI at reported industry use levels and up to seven times the ADI when used at maximum permitted levels.\n\nIn 2024, during a European Commission meeting, Member States agreed that fruit coating additives (including sucrose esters of fatty acids) should only be allowed if technologically necessary for fruits with inedible skins and intended for extended transport, such as tropical fruits. The Commission proposed removing authorization for these additives on apples, pears, and peaches, as these are fruits with commonly consumed skins. A regulatory amendment proposal was submitted to Member States, with a response requested by the end of June 2024. As of now, no regulatory change has been implemented.\n\nIn the United States, sucrose esters of fatty acids are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as emulsifiers, stabilizers, or texturizers in various product categories, including baked goods, certain dairy products, chewing gum, and frozen desserts. They are also authorized as coating agents for certain fresh fruits, such as apples, avocados, bananas, plantains, limes, melons, papayas, peaches, pears, pineapples, and plums. The composition of this additive must also meet FDA specifications, particularly regarding the presence of contaminants such as heavy metals.\"",

      "\"E452iv_long_description\" : \"Phosphates have several functions: leavening agents, stabilizers, acidity regulators, and humectants. Many types of food contain phosphates, including baked goods, processed meat, and dairy products.\n\nPhosphates contain phosphorus, a chemical element essential for many biological processes. Notably, it is involved in many of the body's biochemical reactions, as well as in bone mineral density. Therefore, a recommended dietary allowance (RDA) has been established for phosphorous. Phosphorus is naturally present in animal-based and plant-based products. However, according to the 2015 opinion of the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety. (ANSES), phosphorus intakes in Europe are 2 to 3 times greater than the RDA, primarily due to the widespread use of phosphate food additives and the high consumption of meat and dairy products. National surveys in the United States conducted from 2015-2016 show a similar trend: Americans consume 1.5 to 3 times the RDA of phosphorous, depending on their age group. In addition, scientific reviews from 2013 and 2019 indicate that phosphorus intakes in the United States are underestimated by more than 20% in nutrition databases. This underestimation could be exacerbated by the increase in the use of fast-food and away-from-home establishments, where nutritional information is often missing or incomplete. \n\nAccording to several studies conducted between 2012 and 2023, excessive dietary phosphorus intake can cause many health problems. It may be directly harmful to the kidneys because when the kidneys' capacity to filter out excess phosphorus is exceeded, it can accumulate in the blood. Therefore, people with kidney disease need to carefully monitor their phosphorus intake. Excess phosphorus in the blood could also disrupt calcium metabolism and bone mineralization, which could lead to osteoporosis. It is also suspected of promoting vascular calcification, which is associated with increased cardiovascular mortality. In addition, phosphates from inorganic food additives are more easily absorbed and may have more adverse effects on cardiovascular health than those naturally present in food.\n\nStudies conducted in 2023 and 2024 by the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM) also suggest direct associations between high intakes of some phosphate additives and an increased risk of some chronic diseases. These studies observed a 77% increase in the risk of breast cancer (in premenopausal women) for diphosphates, a 15% increase in the risk of type 2 diabetes for potassium phosphate, and a 6% increase in the risk of coronary heart disease for sodium phosphate. However, INSERM concluded that further research is required to confirm these correlations.\n\nIn 2019, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) determined that phosphate intake could exceed the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) in infants, children, and adolescents with a high phosphate diet. In addition, vulnerable patients with kidney disease, which affects 10% of the general population, may not be able to tolerate the ADI. EFSA also concluded that current evidence was insufficient to establish a clear link between excess dietary phosphorus and cardiovascular disease and therefore, further studies were recommended. It is important to note that this opinion does not consider the previously mentioned 2024 Inserm study, which provides new perspectives. \n\nIn the United States, phosphate additives are substances that have been \u201cgenerally recognized as safe\u201d (GRAS) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) since the 1970s. Under US regulations, their use is limited in certain product categories: industrial and acidified cheeses and milk, baked goods, ice cream, jams, and cocoa products. There is no maximum allowable quantity for the other product categories.\n\nBetween 2014 and 2016, several initiatives were launched in the United States to urge the FDA to require the mandatory listing of phosphorus content on product labels. Organizations such as the American Society of Nephrology and the National Kidney Foundation have taken action to advocate for this labeling, but their efforts have been unsuccessful to date.\"",
      "\"E472c_long_description\" : \"This commonly used additive has multiple uses, but is used primarily as an emulsifier. Emulsifiers make it possible to create an emulsion of two liquids that do not mix (oil and water, for example).\n\nIn its scientific opinions from 2020, the EFSA (European Food Safety Authority) concluded that given the quantities usually consumed, there is no risk to the general population. However, these opinions do not take into account some recent, more incriminating studies regarding emulsifiers.\n\nIn 2023, a study by INSERM (the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research) found a direct correlation between higher intakes of mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids (in particular, derivatives of lactic acid ester and citric acid ester) and a heightened risk of cardiovascular disease (up to +11%). \n\nTests on animals suggest that emulsifiers may also affect gut microbiota and intestinal permeability. This could increase the risk of many diseases, including autoimmune diseases (e.g., Crohn's disease), allergies, metabolic disorders, and inflammatory diseases. These conditions could even lead to the development of colon cancer.\"",

These effects were taken into account in the last Scientific Committee for Food (SCF) report in 2000 on the safety of cyclamates, and to establish the ADI at 7 mg/kg body weight/day.\n\nIn 2015, the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety (ANSES) found a \"lack of nutritional benefit\" for the consumption of intense sweeteners. Its research demonstrated no effect, whether positive or negative, of intense sweeteners on weight control. The ANSES also recommends studying the possible interactions between body size, consumption of intense sweeteners and weight gain. More broadly, the issue of nutritional risks linked to consumption of sweeteners remains unclear. Moreover, some recent data suggests a link between consumption of sweeteners and weight gain. \n\nAccording to a 2020 study, cyclamate supplementation may lead to weight gain and higher food intake.\n\nIn addition, a 2019 in vitro study suggests that cyclamates may be toxic to bone cells.\n\nIn general, sweeteners may also disturb the intestinal flora and promote metabolic disorders, particularly the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. In addition, a study by the French National Institute for Health and Medical Research (Inserm) demonstrated that diet beverages are associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes.\n\nFinally, two Inserm (French National Institute of Health and Medical Research) studies published in 2022 suggest an association between the overall consumption of sweeteners and an increased risk of cancer and cardiovascular disease Cyclamates were among the sweeteners studied in these two analyses, through a cumulative consumption with other sweeteners.\"",

      "\"E212_long_description\" : \"Benzoic acid and its salts (sodium benzoate and potassium benzoate) are preservatives mainly found in sodas, fruit juices, and sauces. They are used for controlling microorganisms and preventing food oxidation.\n\nOne of the concerns regarding this additive lies in its potential to form benzene when combined with ascorbic acid (in the form of natural vitamin C or as an additive). Benzene is classified as a carcinogen for humans (Group 1) by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). This risk of a potentially dangerous chemical interaction underscores the importance of carefully monitoring ingredients in food products that combine these two compounds, particularly flavored soft drinks. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) noted this interaction in its 2016 opinion. It recommended considering the formulation and storage conditions of soft drinks to minimize benzene formation, as higher storage temperatures can contribute to this formation.\n\nAnother concern about this additive is the potential risk of exceeding the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) in children. According to the 2016 EFSA opinion, young children who are heavy consumers of foods containing this additive, particularly flavored drinks, could exceed the ADI. Additionally, as early as 1974, the World Health Organization (WHO) established an ADI of 5 mg/kg body weight/day, based on studies that revealed reprotoxic effects (toxic effects on reproduction) in rats.\n\nMore recently, a 2020 study reinforced concerns about this additive, showing that it could disrupt sperm formation and function, as well as sex hormone levels. That same year, other research highlighted toxic effects on blood and the immune system after prolonged exposure to doses close to the ADI. Furthermore, studies conducted in 2021 and 2023 observed signs of renal and hepatic toxicity in rats.\n\nThe EFSA also indicated in 2016 that this additive could increase hypersensitivity and provoke skin reactions. Various cases of intolerance to benzoic acid and its salts have been reported in scientific literature, including skin reactions, gastrointestinal disorders, bronchial hyperreactivity, asthma attacks, and effects on the central nervous system. These reactions can occur even at doses lower than the ADI in individuals sensitive to benzoate.\n\nThis preservative is also suspected of contributing to hyperactivity and attention deficit disorders in children when combined with certain colorants. However, the EFSA ruled out this risk in its 2008 and 2016 re-evaluations. The EFSA acknowledges that the results of the main incriminating study show a real impact on some individuals particularly sensitive to food additives and/or colorants. However, the EFSA expert committee emphasizes that these results cannot be generalized to the entire population.\n\nFinally, the EFSA recommends revising the maximum limits for toxic element impurities (lead, mercury, and arsenic) related to benzoic acid and its salts to ensure that additives do not become a significant source of exposure to these toxic elements.\n\nIn the United States, this preservative is part of the \u201cGenerally Recognized as Safe\u201d (GRAS) substances by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), but its use and dosage are limited based on product categories. This additive was approved by the FDA in 1973, which has not published a new opinion since, taking into account more recent studies on this additive.\"",

      "\"E432_long_description\" : \"Polysorbates are artificial additives made from sorbitol. They are used as emulsifiers to mix normally immiscible substances (such as water and oil), and as stabilizers to prevent the formation of deposits. They are found in salad dressings, ice creams, broths, and coconut milks and creams.\n\nDuring its reevaluation of polysorbates in 2015, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) indicated that the data available at the time was insufficient to assess actual exposure to these additives, but that certain population groups (in particular, young children) risked exceeding the acceptable daily intake (ADI) for this group of additives. Nevertheless, the EFSA ruled out risks related to genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, and reproductive toxicity. It acknowledged the existence of incriminating data with regard to intestinal microbiota, but did not formally take this data into account in its risk assessment. Ultimately, the EFSA recommended that the maximum limits for the impurities of toxic elements (such as lead, mercury, and arsenic) be revised to ensure that polysorbates do not represent a significant source of exposure to these toxic elements.\n\nBetween 2015 and 2024 (since the EFSA evaluation), emulsifiers have been the subject of several studies highlighting their potentially harmful effects, particularly on the gut. These studies suggest that emulsifiers can disrupt the gut microbiota, leading to chronic inflammation that can contribute to the development of chronic diseases such as obesity, type II diabetes, cancer, and inflammatory bowel disease. A 2020 study showed that polysorbate 80 may increase intestinal permeability, allowing harmful substances and pathogens to enter the body more easily and thereby increasing vulnerability to toxins and infections. More recently, in 2023, a study showed that polysorbate 80 may inhibit the growth of probiotics, bacteria that are essential to the proper functioning of the gut, all the while promoting harmful bacteria that may cause relapses in people suffering from Crohn's disease.\n\nIn 2024, a study by the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM) examined the potential link between polysorbate 80 consumption and the risk of cancer. Although the results showed no direct link, the researchers did highlight one major limitation: the subjects consumed much less polysorbate 80 than those observed in other studies. This difference could explain why the study established no direct link. The study also raised a wider concern: people consuming large quantities of emulsifiers in general could be exposed to an increased risk of cancer.\n \nIn the USA, polysorbate 80 was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1978, albeit with specific manufacturing specifications and concentration limits depending on the type of use. Despite the concerns raised by recent research, the FDA has not changed its rules on this additive since providing its initial approval.\"",

(ANSES), phosphorus intakes in Europe are 2 to 3 times greater than the RDA, primarily due to the widespread use of phosphate food additives and the high consumption of meat and dairy products. National surveys in the United States conducted from 2015-2016 show a similar trend: Americans consume 1.5 to 3 times the RDA of phosphorous, depending on their age group. In addition, scientific reviews from 2013 and 2019 indicate that phosphorus intakes in the United States are underestimated by more than 20% in nutrition databases. This underestimation could be exacerbated by the increase in the use of fast-food and away-from-home establishments, where nutritional information is often missing or incomplete. \n\nAccording to several studies conducted between 2012 and 2023, excessive dietary phosphorus intake can cause many health problems. It may be directly harmful to the kidneys because when the kidneys' capacity to filter out excess phosphorus is exceeded, it can accumulate in the blood. Therefore, people with kidney disease need to carefully monitor their phosphorus intake. Excess phosphorus in the blood could also disrupt calcium metabolism and bone mineralization, which could lead to osteoporosis. It is also suspected of promoting vascular calcification, which is associated with increased cardiovascular mortality. In addition, phosphates from inorganic food additives are more easily absorbed and may have more adverse effects on cardiovascular health than those naturally present in food.\n\nStudies conducted in 2023 and 2024 by the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM) also suggest direct associations between high intakes of some phosphate additives and an increased risk of some chronic diseases. These studies observed a 77% increase in the risk of breast cancer (in premenopausal women) for diphosphates, a 15% increase in the risk of type 2 diabetes for potassium phosphate, and a 6% increase in the risk of coronary heart disease for sodium phosphate. However, INSERM concluded that further research is required to confirm these correlations.\n\nIn 2019, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) determined that phosphate intake could exceed the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) in infants, children, and adolescents with a high phosphate diet. In addition, vulnerable patients with kidney disease, which affects 10% of the general population, may not be able to tolerate the ADI. EFSA also concluded that current evidence was insufficient to establish a clear link between excess dietary phosphorus and cardiovascular disease and therefore, further studies were recommended. It is important to note that this opinion does not consider the previously mentioned 2024 Inserm study, which provides new perspectives. \n\nIn the United States, phosphate additives are substances that have been \u201cgenerally recognized as safe\u201d (GRAS) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) since the 1970s. Under US regulations, their use is limited in certain product categories: industrial and acidified cheeses and milk, baked goods, ice cream, jams, and cocoa products. There is no maximum allowable quantity for the other product categories.\n\nBetween 2014 and 2016, several initiatives were launched in the United States to urge the FDA to require the mandatory listing of phosphorus content on product labels. Organizations such as the American Society of Nephrology and the National Kidney Foundation have taken action to advocate for this labeling, but their efforts have been unsuccessful to date.\"",

Its research demonstrated no effect, whether positive or negative, of intense sweeteners on weight control. The ANSES also recommends studying the possible interactions between body size, consumption of intense sweeteners and weight gain. More broadly, the issue of nutritional risks linked to consumption of sweeteners remains unclear. Moreover, some recent data suggests a link between consumption of sweeteners and weight gain. \n\nIn 2022, the EFSA (European Food Safety Authority) re-evaluated the safety of E959, and assigned an ADI of 20 mg/kg body weight/day. Still according to the EFSA, European populations are exposed to quantities of E959 below this ADI: the experts have therefore concluded that this additive is safe under current conditions of use.\n\nHowever, two Inserm (French National Institute of Health and Medical Research) studies published in 2022 - which were not taken into account in the EFSA re-evaluation - suggested an association between the overall consumption of sweeteners and an increased risk of cancer and cardiovascular disease.

      "\"E522_long_description\" : \"Sodium aluminum sulfate is used as a leavening agent (to help dough rise), a firming agent (to help maintain a firm texture) and a stabilizer (to help stabilize mixtures) in a variety of products. This additive is banned in Australia. In the European Union, it is authorized only in two product categories: candied cherries and liquid egg whites. In the USA and Canada, however, it is commonly used in a wide range of bakery products, such as baking powders, tortillas and cookies.\n\nThe major concern is that this additive contributes to the total dietary intake of aluminum, which is too high for a large part of the population, according to the 2008 scientific opinion of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). Although aluminum is mostly eliminated from the body via the stool when ingested, it can accumulate in various tissues, such as bones, liver, lungs, kidneys, and even the brain.\n\nThis is concerning for several reasons. Firstly, it is associated with potential adverse effects on reproduction and fetal development, according to a 2011 document from the World Health Organization (WHO). In addition, it is suspected of causing DNA damage and increasing the risk of diseases such as multiple sclerosis, asthma, autism, epilepsy, and neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease. Although aluminum levels in each food product are generally below the risk threshold, the accumulation from several sources of daily exposure (food, water, cosmetics) can exceed the recommended limits according to several institutions and agencies such as the WHO and the EFSA.\n\nIn its 2018 opinion, the EFSA noted that the European population's exposure to aluminum sulfates is very low, mainly thanks to regulatory restrictions enacted in 2012 that limited their use to certain categories of food products. However, the EFSA has expressed concern that children, as well as heavy consumers of aluminum-containing products, may be exceeding the tolerable weekly intake (TWI) of aluminum. It therefore recommended a global assessment of aluminum exposure from all food additives to better manage health risks.\n\nIn the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has listed this additive as a \"generally recognized as safe\" (GRAS) substance, and there are no specific restrictions on its use as a food additive. The FDA has not taken a position on the risks of this additive since its approval in 1975 to take into account scientific studies published since then. A 2005 study by an American university also showed that certain baked goods that use baking powders containing aluminum salts can be sufficient to reach the tolerable weekly intake in a single serving.\n\"",

However, that opinion does not take into account some recent, incriminating studies regarding emulsifiers.\n\n In 2023, a study by INSERM (the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research) found that higher intakes of cellulose (in particular, cellulose gum) can lead to a heightened risk of cardiovascular disease (up to +7%). Further studies are required to confirm this finding.\n\nMoreover, the EFSA did not study digestive upset or the risks of increased intestinal permeability or changes to intestinal flora, concerns raised by recent animal studies.\n\nIndeed, some studies suggest that emulsifiers modify intestinal permeability, causing intestinal barrier dysfunction. They may thus increase the risk of auto-immune disorders (such as Crohn's disease) and allergies.\n\nOther studies suggest that emulsifiers may disrupt the intestinal flora and promote inflammation, increasing the risk of inflammatory diseases and metabolic syndrome.

Many types of food contain phosphates, including baked goods, processed meat, and dairy products.\n\nPhosphates contain phosphorus, a chemical element essential for many biological processes. Notably, it is involved in many of the body's biochemical reactions, as well as in bone mineral density. Therefore, a recommended dietary allowance (RDA) has been established for phosphorous. Phosphorus is naturally present in animal-based and plant-based products. However, according to the 2015 opinion of the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety. (ANSES), phosphorus intakes in Europe are 2 to 3 times greater than the RDA, primarily due to the widespread use of phosphate food additives and the high consumption of meat and dairy products. National surveys in the United States conducted from 2015-2016 show a similar trend: Americans consume 1.5 to 3 times the RDA of phosphorous, depending on their age group. In addition, scientific reviews from 2013 and 2019 indicate that phosphorus intakes in the United States are underestimated by more than 20% in nutrition databases. This underestimation could be exacerbated by the increase in the use of fast-food and away-from-home establishments, where nutritional information is often missing or incomplete. \n\nAccording to several studies conducted between 2012 and 2023, excessive dietary phosphorus intake can cause many health problems. It may be directly harmful to the kidneys because when the kidneys' capacity to filter out excess phosphorus is exceeded, it can accumulate in the blood. Therefore, people with kidney disease need to carefully monitor their phosphorus intake. Excess phosphorus in the blood could also disrupt calcium metabolism and bone mineralization, which could lead to osteoporosis. It is also suspected of promoting vascular calcification, which is associated with increased cardiovascular mortality. In addition, phosphates from inorganic food additives are more easily absorbed and may have more adverse effects on cardiovascular health than those naturally present in food.\n\nStudies conducted in 2023 and 2024 by the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM) also suggest direct associations between high intakes of some phosphate additives and an increased risk of some chronic diseases. These studies observed a 77% increase in the risk of breast cancer (in premenopausal women) for diphosphates, a 15% increase in the risk of type 2 diabetes for potassium phosphate, and a 6% increase in the risk of coronary heart disease for sodium phosphate. However, INSERM concluded that further research is required to confirm these correlations.\n\nIn 2019, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) determined that phosphate intake could exceed the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) in infants, children, and adolescents with a high phosphate diet.

      "\"E950_long_description\" : \"Acesulfame potassium is a very powerful artificial sweetener that is about 200 times sweeter than sugar (sucrose). It is used in many so-called \"diet\" or sugar-free products. \n\nAcesulfame potassium is currently associated with a number of health risks:\n\n\u2022 Acesulfame potassium and cancer\n\nIn 2022, a cohort study by the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM) showed that acesulfame potassium consumption could be associated with a 12\u201313% increased risk of cancer in humans. The study also suggests that the consumption of sweeteners in general may be associated with an increased risk of cancer, similar to excessive sugar consumption. The scientists who conducted the study therefore \"do not advise using artificial sweeteners as safe substitutes for sugar in foods and beverages.\" They also point out that the participants' acesulfame potassium consumption was below the acceptable daily intake (ADI) established by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). However, the research team conducting this cancer study highlights some uncertainties. Further studies are therefore required at this stage to confirm this correlation.\n\nMoreover, two studies from 1997 and 2008 suggest that acesulfame potassium may damage cell DNA, which is a risk factor for tumor development.\n\n\u2022 Acesulfame potassium and chronic diseases\n\nSeveral studies published between 2014 and 2022 suggest that sweeteners may disrupt our intestinal flora and affect the mucus layer that protects our intestines from microbes. This dysregulation contributes to ongoing intestinal inflammation, weakening our immune system and increasing the risk of developing long-term metabolic problems like insulin resistance, glucose intolerance (a frequent transition stage to type 2 diabetes), and weight gain.\n\nIn 2023, a cohort study conducted by INSERM on over 100,000 participants suggests that consumption of acesulfame potassium could increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 39\u201370%.\n\nA 2022 cohort study, also conducted by INSERM, shows that acesulfame potassium consumption may be associated with a 40% increase in the risk of developing coronary heart disease (arterial damage and impaired blood circulation).\n\nParticular care should be taken with young children and pregnant women. In fact, several recent studies have found that exposure to acesulfame potassium from an early age may permanently disrupt glucose regulation and sugar dependency. Furthermore, consuming the sweetener during pregnancy could have an effect on newborn metabolism and microbiota, according to several studies published between 2019 and 2022.\n\n\u2022 Acesulfame potassium and its effects on weight\n\nIn 2015, the French Agency for Food, Environmental, and Occupational Health & Safety (ANSES) found that \"the data is insufficient to rule on a nutritional benefit\" associated with the consumption of intense sweeteners. Its work showed that intense sweeteners played no part (positive or negative) in controlling weight.\n\nA scientific review of several studies published in 2017 goes even further, concluding that sweeteners could be \"associated with an increase in waist circumference\" and \"a higher incidence of abdominal obesity and excess weight\" over the long term.\n\nThis additive has been approved in the United States since 1988, first in limited products and then, as of 2003, in all products except meat. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers that the quantities consumed daily pose no health risk. In Europe, the most recent health risk assessment for acesulfame potassium was conducted in 2000, and it concluded that the additive was safe at the permitted doses, ruling out the risks of carcinogenicity and mutagencity. However, in 2010, the European Commission asked the EFSA to reassess its safety in the light of the latest scientific studies. There have been no new EFSA opinions published to date.\"",

      "\"E102_long_description\" : \"Tartrazine is a coloring used in candies, soft drinks, and snacks, among other products.\n\nFirstly, this coloring is suspected of promoting hyperactivity and attention deficit disorders in children when combined with sodium benzoate, according to a 2007 study. In 2009, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) downplayed the conclusions of this study, stating that there was no evidence of a cause-and-effect relationship. The EFSA noted that a mixture of colorings was used in this study, so it is unclear whether the effects can be attributed specifically to this coloring, another coloring, or a cocktail effect. Therefore, the EFSA deemed it unnecessary to revise the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI). In 2010, following the 2007 incriminating study, the European Commission decided to strengthen regulations: foods containing this additive must bear the warning \"May have adverse effects on activity and attention in children.\"\n\nIn the United States, in 2011, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed the 2007 incriminating study in response to a petition from the Center for Science in the Public Interest requesting the ban of certain artificial food colorings. Like EFSA, the experts concluded that the study did not prove a cause-and-effect link between the colorings and attention deficit disorder with or without hyperactivity (ADHD) in children. The FDA determined that mandatory labeling, as used in Europe, was not necessary.\n\nIn 2012, a scientific review and meta-analysis of more than 20 studies concluded that artificial food colorings could significantly contribute to some cases of ADHD, even if they are not the primary cause of ADHD itself. The researchers also noted that the harmful effects of artificial colorings extend beyond ADHD and could be a broader public health issue. They emphasized that the evidence on the impact of food colorings on children\u2019s behavior is inconclusive but \u201ctoo significant to ignore.\u201d Pending further research, the researchers recommended caution and limiting children's exposure to artificial colorings, whose use has quadrupled in the United States over the past 50 years.\n\nFurthermore, a 2015 study focusing solely on the effects of tartrazine showed that it could also affect the central nervous system by reducing dopamine and serotonin levels in rats, potentially impacting mood and behavior.\n\nAccording to EFSA's 2009 opinion, tartrazine could also trigger hypersensitivity and intolerance reactions (hives, asthma) in individuals who are generally sensitive to additives and colorings, even at doses below the ADI. A 2023 study indicated that tartrazine is the azo food coloring most suspected of causing allergic and intolerance reactions.\n\nAdditionally, tartrazine raises concerns for its effects on the liver, pancreas, and kidneys. Animal studies between 2010 and 2022 show that high-dose consumption could cause oxidative stress in these organs, increasing the risk of certain chronic diseases. A 2010 rat study even observed signs of liver toxicity at doses close to the ADI.\n\nAnother issue is its impact on reproduction. A 2009 study conducted on mice demonstrated that excessive consumption of this coloring could have harmful effects on reproductive organs, reduce fertility, and increase sperm abnormalities.\n\nMoreover, 2022 and 2023 studies highlighted the negative effects of this coloring on the gut microbiota, particularly through the production of certain genotoxic and potentially carcinogenic substances (aromatic amines) during digestion.\n\nIn the United States, the ADI for tartrazine is stricter than in Europe. It was set in 1969 and has not been updated to take recent studies on this additive into account.\n\nTwo scientific reviews from 2021 and 2022, conducted by American public health research centers, concluded that the current ADI might be inadequate. The researchers recommended reevaluating children's exposure to this coloring and conducting additional research to establish more protective ADIs against undesirable neurobehavioral effects. A 2023 study noted that other azo colorings have been banned due to their carcinogenic metabolites, but the effects of those from tartrazine remain poorly understood, also calling for further research.\n\nHowever, this coloring, along with five others, will be banned in public schools in California starting in 2028.\"",
      "\"E452i_long_description\" : \"Phosphates have several functions: leavening agents, stabilizers, acidity regulators, and humectants. Many types of food contain phosphates, including baked goods, processed meat, and dairy products.\n\nPhosphates contain phosphorus, a chemical element essential for many biological processes. Notably, it is involved in many of the body's biochemical reactions, as well as in bone mineral density. Therefore, a recommended dietary allowance (RDA) has been established for phosphorous. Phosphorus is naturally present in animal-based and plant-based products. However, according to the 2015 opinion of the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety. (ANSES), phosphorus intakes in Europe are 2 to 3 times greater than the RDA, primarily due to the widespread use of phosphate food additives and the high consumption of meat and dairy products. National surveys in the United States conducted from 2015-2016 show a similar trend: Americans consume 1.5 to 3 times the RDA of phosphorous, depending on their age group. In addition, scientific reviews from 2013 and 2019 indicate that phosphorus intakes in the United States are underestimated by more than 20% in nutrition databases. This underestimation could be exacerbated by the increase in the use of fast-food and away-from-home establishments, where nutritional information is often missing or incomplete. \n\nAccording to several studies conducted between 2012 and 2023, excessive dietary phosphorus intake can cause many health problems. It may be directly harmful to the kidneys because when the kidneys' capacity to filter out excess phosphorus is exceeded, it can accumulate in the blood. Therefore, people with kidney disease need to carefully monitor their phosphorus intake. Excess phosphorus in the blood could also disrupt calcium metabolism and bone mineralization, which could lead to osteoporosis. It is also suspected of promoting vascular calcification, which is associated with increased cardiovascular mortality. In addition, phosphates from inorganic food additives are more easily absorbed and may have more adverse effects on cardiovascular health than those naturally present in food.\n\nStudies conducted in 2023 and 2024 by the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM) also suggest direct associations between high intakes of some phosphate additives and an increased risk of some chronic diseases. These studies observed a 77% increase in the risk of breast cancer (in premenopausal women) for diphosphates, a 15% increase in the risk of type 2 diabetes for potassium phosphate, and a 6% increase in the risk of coronary heart disease for sodium phosphate. However, INSERM concluded that further research is required to confirm these correlations.\n\nIn 2019, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) determined that phosphate intake could exceed the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) in infants, children, and adolescents with a high phosphate diet. In addition, vulnerable patients with kidney disease, which affects 10% of the general population, may not be able to tolerate the ADI. EFSA also concluded that current evidence was insufficient to establish a clear link between excess dietary phosphorus and cardiovascular disease and therefore, further studies were recommended. It is important to note that this opinion does not consider the previously mentioned 2024 Inserm study, which provides new perspectives. \n\nIn the United States, phosphate additives are substances that have been \u201cgenerally recognized as safe\u201d (GRAS) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) since the 1970s. Under US regulations, their use is limited in certain product categories: industrial and acidified cheeses and milk, baked goods, ice cream, jams, and cocoa products. There is no maximum allowable quantity for the other product categories.\n\nBetween 2014 and 2016, several initiatives were launched in the United States to urge the FDA to require the mandatory listing of phosphorus content on product labels. Organizations such as the American Society of Nephrology and the National Kidney Foundation have taken action to advocate for this labeling, but their efforts have been unsuccessful to date.\"",

      "\"E213_long_description\" : \"Benzoic acid and its salts (sodium benzoate and potassium benzoate) are preservatives mainly found in sodas, fruit juices, and sauces. They are used for controlling microorganisms and preventing food oxidation.\n\nOne of the concerns regarding this additive lies in its potential to form benzene when combined with ascorbic acid (in the form of natural vitamin C or as an additive). Benzene is classified as a carcinogen for humans (Group 1) by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). This risk of a potentially dangerous chemical interaction underscores the importance of carefully monitoring ingredients in food products that combine these two compounds, particularly flavored soft drinks. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) noted this interaction in its 2016 opinion. It recommended considering the formulation and storage conditions of soft drinks to minimize benzene formation, as higher storage temperatures can contribute to this formation.\n\nAnother concern about this additive is the potential risk of exceeding the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) in children. According to the 2016 EFSA opinion, young children who are heavy consumers of foods containing this additive, particularly flavored drinks, could exceed the ADI. Additionally, as early as 1974, the World Health Organization (WHO) established an ADI of 5 mg/kg body weight/day, based on studies that revealed reprotoxic effects (toxic effects on reproduction) in rats.\n\nMore recently, a 2020 study reinforced concerns about this additive, showing that it could disrupt sperm formation and function, as well as sex hormone levels. That same year, other research highlighted toxic effects on blood and the immune system after prolonged exposure to doses close to the ADI. Furthermore, studies conducted in 2021 and 2023 observed signs of renal and hepatic toxicity in rats.\n\nThe EFSA also indicated in 2016 that this additive could increase hypersensitivity and provoke skin reactions. Various cases of intolerance to benzoic acid and its salts have been reported in scientific literature, including skin reactions, gastrointestinal disorders, bronchial hyperreactivity, asthma attacks, and effects on the central nervous system. These reactions can occur even at doses lower than the ADI in individuals sensitive to benzoate.\n\nThis preservative is also suspected of contributing to hyperactivity and attention deficit disorders in children when combined with certain colorants. However, the EFSA ruled out this risk in its 2008 and 2016 re-evaluations. The EFSA acknowledges that the results of the main incriminating study show a real impact on some individuals particularly sensitive to food additives and/or colorants. However, the EFSA expert committee emphasizes that these results cannot be generalized to the entire population.\n\nFinally, the EFSA recommends revising the maximum limits for toxic element impurities (lead, mercury, and arsenic) related to benzoic acid and its salts to ensure that additives do not become a significant source of exposure to these toxic elements.\n\nIn the United States, this preservative is part of the \u201cGenerally Recognized as Safe\u201d (GRAS) substances by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), but its use and dosage are limited based on product categories. This additive was approved by the FDA in 1973, which has not published a new opinion since, taking into account more recent studies on this additive.\"",

      "\"E551_long_description\" : \"Silicon dioxide, also known as silica, is notably used as an anti-caking agent to prevent ingredients in powdered form from clumping due to moisture. It is often employed in dry or powdered foods such as dehydrated soups, spices, grain-based infant formulas, instant coffee and chocolate-flavored powders.\n\nThis additive can also be used as a processing aid, meaning that it can be used in the stages of food processing. When that happens, it does not appear in the list of ingredients on the packaging, but it may still be present in the final product without the consumer having access to this information.\n\nOne of the main risks associated with this additive is that it can occur as nanoparticles. Nanoparticles are particles which, because of their small size, can penetrate the body more easily. They are also more reactive, potentially toxic and can accumulate in different organs. The ability of nanoparticles to interact differently with the body compared to larger particles is a concern that has been highlighted by several studies. In an opinion published in 2020, the French National Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety (ANSES) confirmed that this additive contains nanoparticles.\n\nStudies focusing specifically on silicon dioxide (silica) have explored the effects of nanoparticles from this additive in greater detail. A scientific review of several studies published in 2024 revealed that, when ingested, silica nanoparticles can remain in the gut and disrupt the microbiome, increasing the risk of inflammatory bowel disease. Moreover, these nanoparticles can also trigger oxidative stress in certain intestinal cells and alter their normal function. Furthermore, a study conducted in 2024 by the French National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and the Environment (INRAE) and McMaster University in Canada suggested that chronic exposure to silicon dioxide as a food additive could reduce the number of certain intestinal immune cells and that it could be a trigger for coeliac disease in genetically predisposed individuals.\n\nFinally, studies from 2021 suggest that silicon dioxide nanoparticles can also damage kidney tissue and impair liver function. The authors of one of these studies indicate that a risk to human health cannot be ruled out, and recommend further research to better understand the toxicity mechanisms, which are still not well understood.\n\nThe effects of nanoparticles have not been fully investigated, and studies are still needed to better understand their impact on health. In 2018 and 2021, the EFSA recommended a revision of European Union rules to include a more precise characterization of particle size in additives.\n\nIn its 2018 report, the EFSA concluded that there was no indication of toxicity for this additive at the reported levels of use. However, the agency stressed that the available data had limitations, and recommended that chronic toxicity studies be carried out, taking into account the presence of a nanoparticulate fraction in silicon dioxide, in order to define an Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI). \nIn 2024, the EFSA published a new opinion incorporating new available data on the characterization of nanoparticles in this additive. In this opinion, the expert panel concluded that silicon dioxide would not raise health concerns for consumers. However, this conclusion is based on a safety factor almost three times lower than that often used for other additives. The panel has still not been able to establish an ADI, believing that existing studies on nanoparticles are still insufficient or do not comply with the technical guidelines defined by the EFSA in 2021. The EFSA nevertheless stressed that the ability of silicon dioxide to disrupt intestinal immune balance merits further investigation, particularly in humans, as this could predispose individuals to food allergies and celiac disease in particular. Finally, the EFSA recommends reducing the maximum limits for certain heavy metals such as lead, mercury and arsenic, and introducing maximum limits for aluminum.\n\nIn the USA, silicon dioxide has been authorized by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) since 1977 as an anti-caking agent, provided that quantities do not exceed 2% of the finished product by weight. No re-evaluation has been conducted since it was authorized in 1975 to account for recent studies on the additive.\"",

Sorbitan monostearate has also been found to contribute to an increased risk of diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease.\n\nIn our bodies, sorbitan esters are broken down into sorbitol and sorbitol fatty acids. According to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), these by-products are safe: the fatty acids are used by the body, and the sorbitol is eliminated through urine and feces. Nevertheless, a study from 2017 found that a high consumption of products containing sorbitol can lead to digestive problems such as gas, bloating, and diarrhea, in particular due to sorbitol's laxative properties and its intolerance in certain people.\n\nIn 2017, the EFSA ruled out the risk of genotoxicity (a substance's ability to damage DNA), but the effects on gut microbiota were not evaluated due to a lack of studies on the subject at that time. The EFSA underscored the general lack of long-term studies which are required to better assess the chronic effects of this additive. However, it indicated that studies on the acute effects were sufficient to establish an acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 10 mg of sorbitan per day per kg of body weight. \n\nThe EFSA also stressed the need to reduce the current limits for certain toxic elements (arsenic, cadmium, lead, and mercury) present in these additives to avoid excessive dietary exposures.\n\nIn addition, the committee emphasized the lack of data on the types and usage levels of sorbitan esters, as well as analytical data on their actual presence in food products. This lack of data makes assessments of actual consumer exposure to these additives less precise and less realistic. \n\nThis additive is authorized in the United States by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration), and is subject to compliance with precise manufacturing specifications and concentration limits defined according to its use and its combination with other emulsifiers. \n\n\"",

Several studies conducted between 2004 and 2018 indicate that BHA could alter the secretion of sex hormones, change sperm morphology, affect uterine weight, impair fertility, and disrupt fetal organ weight and development. Special caution is therefore advised for pregnant women and young children.\n\nIn its 2012 report, EFSA estimated that the average BHA intake across the population could exceed the acceptable daily intake (ADI), posing a health risk. This overexposure is linked to its use as an additive and its presence in certain plastic food packaging. The agency noted that the highest exposures affect infants and young children (relative to their body weight) but made no recommendation to limit this exposure. This ADI is also less stringent than that set by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1988.\n\nIn the United States, BHA is classified as \u201cGenerally Recognized as Safe\u201d (GRAS) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), though its usage and dosage are limited according to product categories. This additive was approved by the FDA in 1973, and no updated review has been published since, considering more recent studies on this additive.\"",

      "\"E961_long_description\" : \"Neotame is a synthetic intense sweetener with a sweetening power 7,000 to 13,000 times greater than sugar (sucrose). It is used in many \"light\" or sugar-free products and beverages. Neotame is currently implicated in various risks:\n\n\u2022 Neotame and cancer\n\nA cohort study by the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM) revealed that high consumption of sweeteners in general may be associated with a 13-14% increase in the risk of developing cancer in humans. This study also suggests that the consumption of sweeteners is associated with an increased risk of cancer, similar to excessive sugar consumption. Therefore, the scientists who conducted this study indicated that they \u201cdo not support the use of artificial sweeteners as safe substitutes for sugar in foods or beverages.\u201d\n\nThis study highlights a link between overall high consumption of sweeteners and an increased risk of cancer, but it did not investigate the specific correlation related to neotame consumption.\n\n\u2022 Neotame and chronic diseases\n\nSweeteners are suspected of disrupting our gut flora and affecting the mucus layer that protects our intestines from microbes, according to several studies published between 2014 and 2022. This imbalance contributes to continuous inflammation in the intestine, weakens the immune system, and increases the risk of developing long-term metabolic problems, such as insulin resistance, glucose intolerance (a common stage before type 2 diabetes), and weight gain.\n\nIn 2023, a cohort study conducted by INSERM suggested that sweetener consumption in general could increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 30-69%.\n\nA 2022 cohort study, also conducted by INSERM, showed that sweetener consumption in general could be associated with a 9% increase in the risk of developing cardiovascular disease, and more specifically a cerebrovascular disease, with an 18% increase in risk.\n\nAs with the cancer study, these two INSERM studies highlight a link between overall artificial sweetener consumption and an increased risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, but did not examine the specific correlation related to neotame consumption.\n\n\u2022 Neotame and weight effects\n\nIn 2015, the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety (ANSES) concluded that \u201cthe data is insufficient to determine a nutritional benefit\u201d for the consumption of intense sweeteners. Its research demonstrated no positive or negative effect of intense sweeteners on weight control.\n\nA scientific review of multiple studies published in 2017 went further, concluding that sweeteners were \u201cassociated with an increase in waist circumference\u201d and a \u201chigher incidence of abdominal obesity and overweight\u201d over the long term.\n\nIn Europe, the last health risk assessment of neotame dates back to 2007. However, in 2010, the European Commission requested that the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) reassess its safety to consider the latest scientific studies on the topic. To date, no new EFSA opinion has been published. In the United States, this additive has been authorized since 2002 in all product categories except for meat and poultry. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) believes that the amounts consumed daily do not pose health risks.\"",

      "\"E541ii_long_description\" : \"Sodium aluminum phosphate, used as baking powder, is a mixture of aluminum and phosphoric acid. In the European Union, its use is strictly limited to a single product category (scones and sponge cakes), which means that it is rarely found in European products. In the United States, it is restricted by quantity limits in certain product categories, such as mass-produced cheeses and certain flours, but it remains prevalent in various products such as pancake mixes, cookies, waffles and cakes (where its use is not restricted) and others.\n\nThis additive contributes to the total dietary intake of aluminum, which is too high for a large part of the population, according to the 2008 scientific opinion of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). Although aluminum is mostly eliminated from the body via the stool when ingested, it can accumulate in various tissues, such as bones, liver, lungs, kidneys, and even the brain.\n\nThis is concerning for several reasons. Firstly, it is associated with potential adverse effects on reproduction and fetal development, according to a 2011 document from the World Health Organization (WHO). In addition, it is suspected of causing DNA damage and increasing the risk of diseases such as multiple sclerosis, asthma, autism, epilepsy, and neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease. Although aluminum levels in each food product are generally below the risk threshold, the accumulation from several sources of daily exposure (food, water, cosmetics) can exceed the recommended limits according to several institutions and agencies such as the WHO and the EFSA.\n\nIn its 2018 opinion, the EFSA noted that the European population's exposure to sodium aluminum phosphates is very low, mainly thanks to regulatory restrictions enacted in 2014 that limited their use to a single category of food products. However, the EFSA has expressed concern that children, as well as heavy consumers of aluminum-containing products, may be exceeding the tolerable weekly intake (TWI) of aluminum. It therefore recommended a global assessment of aluminum exposure from all food additives to better manage health risks.\n\nThis additive also contains phosphorus, a vital chemical for the body that plays a role in many biological processes. Notably, it is involved in many of the body's biochemical reactions, as well as in bone mineral density. Therefore, a recommended dietary allowance (RDA) has been established for phosphorous. Phosphorous is naturally present in animal-based and plant-based products. However, according to the 2015 opinion of the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety (ANSES), phosphorus intakes in Europe are 2 to 3 times greater than the RDA, primarily due to the widespread use of phosphate food additives and the high consumption of meat and dairy products. National surveys in the United States conducted in 2015-2016 show a similar trend: Americans consume 1.5 to 3 times the RDA of phosphorous, depending on their age group. In addition, scientific reviews from 2013 and 2019 indicate that phosphorus intakes in the United States are underestimated by more than 20%. This underestimation could be exacerbated by the increase in the use of fast-food and away-from-home establishments, where nutritional information is often missing or incomplete.\n \nAccording to several studies conducted between 2012 and 2023, excessive dietary phosphorus intake can cause many health problems. In particular, it is considered harmful to the kidneys, and those suffering from kidney disease need to carefully monitor their phosphorus intake. Excess phosphorus in the blood could also disrupt calcium metabolism and bone mineralization, which could lead to osteoporosis. It is also suspected of promoting vascular calcification, which is associated with increased cardiovascular mortality. In addition, phosphates from inorganic food additives are more easily absorbed and may have more adverse effects on cardiovascular health than those naturally present in food.\n\nIn the USA, the additive is one of the substances that are \"generally recognized as safe\" (GRAS) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).No re-evaluation has been conducted since it was authorized in 1975 to account for recent studies on the additive.\"",

This additive is banned in Australia. In the European Union, it is authorized only in two product categories: candied cherries and liquid egg whites. In the USA and Canada, however, it is commonly used in a wide range of bakery products, such as baking powders, tortillas and cookies.\n\nThe major concern is that this additive contributes to the total dietary intake of aluminum, which is too high for a large part of the population, according to the 2008 scientific opinion of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA).

      "\"E133_long_description\" : \"Brilliant blue is an artificial blue coloring used to impart intense color to various food products such as confectionery (candies and lollipops), chewing gum, syrups, breakfast cereals, cakes, and flavored drinks.\n\nFirst of all, this coloring is suspected of promoting hyperactivity and attention deficit disorder (ADHD) in children. In 2012, a scientific review and meta-analysis of over 20 studies concluded that artificial food colorings could contribute significantly to some cases of ADHD, even if they are not the main cause of ADHD per se. The researchers also suggest that the deleterious effect of artificial colorings goes beyond ADHD and that they could be a general public health problem. They point out that the evidence for the impact of food colorings on children's behavior is inconclusive but \"too significant to ignore.\" Pending further research, the researchers recommend caution and limiting children's exposure to artificial colorings, whose use has quadrupled in the United States over the past 50 years.\n \nThis risk is all the more concerning as children in Europe, who are major consumers of products containing this coloring, are at risk of exceeding the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI), according to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). In 2010, EFSA's Scientific Committee revised the ADI downwards. In the United States, this risk among children is also concerning. According to a 2021 report by California's Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment, young American children aged 2 to 5 are most exposed to this coloring. This is probably due to their high consumption of products containing icing, such as cupcakes, which are very popular in the United States.\n\nAnother point of concern is the presence of aluminum in some forms of this additive. It can thus contribute to our total aluminium intake, which is too high for a large part of the population, according to the 2008 EFSA opinion. Although aluminum is mostly eliminated from the body via stool when ingested, it can accumulate in various tissues, such as bone, liver, lungs, kidneys, and even the brain.\n\nThis is concerning for several reasons. On the one hand, it is associated with potential effects on reproduction and fetal development, according to a 2011 document from the World Health Organization (WHO). On the other hand, it is suspected of causing DNA damage and increasing the risk of diseases such as multiple sclerosis, asthma, autism, epilepsy, and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Although the quantities of aluminum in individual foods are generally below the danger threshold, the accumulation of several sources of daily exposure (food, water, cosmetics) can lead to recommended limits being exceeded, according to institutions such as the WHO, EFSA, the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR), and the Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety (SCCS).\n\nIn 2010, EFSA ruled out the carcinogenic, genotoxic (toxic to the genome) and reprotoxic (toxic to reproduction) risks associated with this coloring. However, a 2015 study published after this EFSA opinion once again showed that this additive could present genotoxic and cytotoxic (toxic to cells) potential.\n\nIn addition, a 2021 animal study showed that exposure to this additive at doses below the ADI could have a hemato-immunotoxic (toxic to the immune system and blood cells) effect.\n\nAll these effects are all the more concerning given that a 2013 study showed that this dye could enter the bloodstream directly via saliva. This is particularly concerning for products such as lollipops, candies and chewing gums, which remain in contact with the tongue for long periods, increasing exposure and absorption of this colorant in children, a population already at risk of exceeding the ADI.\n\nIn the United States, the ADI for this additive is half as strict as in the EU. It was set by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1982 and is based on experiments funded by a manufacturer of this coloring. It has not since been updated to take account of more recent studies on this additive. A 2021 scientific review, conducted by three American public health and environmental research centers, concluded that the current ADI could not provide adequate protection against adverse neurobehavioral effects. \n\nIn 2011, the FDA rejected a petition from the Center for Science in the Public Interest calling for a ban on certain artificial colorings. However, this coloring will be banned, along with five others, from public schools in California from 2028 onwards.\"",

It can have multiple uses, including as an emulsifier, thickener, setting agent, glazing agent, and stabilizer. However, it is classified as an emulsifier. Emulsifiers make it possible to create an emulsion of two liquids that do not mix (oil and water, for example).\n\nIn its 2018 re-evaluation, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) deemed that this additive provided no cause for concern and that the available data did not point to any risk of genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, or reproductive toxicity. However, that opinion does not take into account some recent, incriminating studies regarding emulsifiers.\n\n In 2023, a study by INSERM (the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research) found that higher intakes of cellulose (in particular, cellulose gum) can lead to a heightened risk of cardiovascular disease (up to +7%). Further studies are required to confirm this finding.\n\nMoreover, the EFSA did not study digestive upset or the risks of increased intestinal permeability or changes to intestinal flora, concerns raised by recent animal studies.\n\nIndeed, some studies suggest that emulsifiers modify intestinal permeability, causing intestinal barrier dysfunction. They may thus increase the risk of auto-immune disorders (such as Crohn's disease) and allergies.\n\nOther studies suggest that emulsifiers may disrupt the intestinal flora and promote inflammation, increasing the risk of inflammatory diseases and metabolic syndrome. Inflammation resulting from modification of the flora by emulsifiers may even promote the development of colon cancer, according to a recent study (Viennois, 2017).\n\nMoreover, experts have called for a revision of specifications pertaining to this additive (heavy metal and solvent residue levels, etc.). Indeed, the Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources Added to Food (ANS) noted gaps in the conclusions and recommendations in opinions published in 2018 (regarding heavy metal levels, for example). In 2023, the EFSA therefore launched a call for data. A scientific opinion is expected shortly from the EFSA that takes into account the new information.\"",

      "\"E228_long_description\" : \"This additive is a sulfite, a sulfur-based compound. Sulfites are used as preservatives (they prevent the development of bacteria and mold) and as antioxidants (they keep products from oxidizing and losing their color). They are often found in wine and in many industrial products (dried fruit, mustard, etc.). Their use is subject to maximum dosage restrictions.\n\nSulfites may cause severe intolerance reactions (blotchy skin, dermatitis, urticaria, asthma, conjunctivitis, migraine, etc.) in sensitive or asthmatic individuals. According to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), 3-10% of people with asthma may have a sulfite intolerance. \n\nMost people with a sensitivity to sulfites develop food intolerance reactions at doses of 20-50 mg per kilogram or liter of sulfites in the food product. As a result, European law requires that sulfites be declared on food labels if their concentration is equal to or greater than 10 mg/kg or 10 mg/L.\n\nIn 2011, a study by the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety (ANSES) found that 2.9% of French adults exceeded the ADI (Acceptable Daily Intake), corresponding to specific groups (heavy consumers of wine, for example). Those data from 2011 have not been updated by ANSES since.\n\nIn a new opinion issued in 2016, the EFSA found that the current safety level ensured sufficient consumer protection. However, the EFSA also acknowledged that the ADI for sulfites may be exceeded by all age groups and indicated that this is a temporary ADI. The EFSA therefore recommended that the ADI be re-evaluated by 2021, following new studies that will take at least 5 years to conduct. The EFSA also recommends that the exact quantity of sulfites be shown on food packaging, in addition to the \"contains sulfites\" label.\"",

      "\"E450_long_description\" : \"Phosphates have several functions: leavening agents, stabilizers, acidity regulators, and humectants. Many types of food contain phosphates, including baked goods, processed meat, and dairy products.\n\nPhosphates contain phosphorus, a chemical element essential for many biological processes. Notably, it is involved in many of the body's biochemical reactions, as well as in bone mineral density. Therefore, a recommended dietary allowance (RDA) has been established for phosphorous. Phosphorus is naturally present in animal-based and plant-based products. However, according to the 2015 opinion of the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety. (ANSES), phosphorus intakes in Europe are 2 to 3 times greater than the RDA, primarily due to the widespread use of phosphate food additives and the high consumption of meat and dairy products. National surveys in the United States conducted from 2015-2016 show a similar trend: Americans consume 1.5 to 3 times the RDA of phosphorous, depending on their age group. In addition, scientific reviews from 2013 and 2019 indicate that phosphorus intakes in the United States are underestimated by more than 20% in nutrition databases. This underestimation could be exacerbated by the increase in the use of fast-food and away-from-home establishments, where nutritional information is often missing or incomplete. \n\nAccording to several studies conducted between 2012 and 2023, excessive dietary phosphorus intake can cause many health problems. It may be directly harmful to the kidneys because when the kidneys' capacity to filter out excess phosphorus is exceeded, it can accumulate in the blood. Therefore, people with kidney disease need to carefully monitor their phosphorus intake. Excess phosphorus in the blood could also disrupt calcium metabolism and bone mineralization, which could lead to osteoporosis. It is also suspected of promoting vascular calcification, which is associated with increased cardiovascular mortality. In addition, phosphates from inorganic food additives are more easily absorbed and may have more adverse effects on cardiovascular health than those naturally present in food.\n\nStudies conducted in 2023 and 2024 by the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM) also suggest direct associations between high intakes of some phosphate additives and an increased risk of some chronic diseases. These studies observed a 77% increase in the risk of breast cancer (in premenopausal women) for diphosphates, a 15% increase in the risk of type 2 diabetes for potassium phosphate, and a 6% increase in the risk of coronary heart disease for sodium phosphate. However, INSERM concluded that further research is required to confirm these correlations.\n\nIn 2019, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) determined that phosphate intake could exceed the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) in infants, children, and adolescents with a high phosphate diet. In addition, vulnerable patients with kidney disease, which affects 10% of the general population, may not be able to tolerate the ADI. EFSA also concluded that current evidence was insufficient to establish a clear link between excess dietary phosphorus and cardiovascular disease and therefore, further studies were recommended. It is important to note that this opinion does not consider the previously mentioned 2024 Inserm study, which provides new perspectives. \n\nIn the United States, phosphate additives are substances that have been \u201cgenerally recognized as safe\u201d (GRAS) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) since the 1970s. Under US regulations, their use is limited in certain product categories: industrial and acidified cheeses and milk, baked goods, ice cream, jams, and cocoa products. There is no maximum allowable quantity for the other product categories.\n\nBetween 2014 and 2016, several initiatives were launched in the United States to urge the FDA to require the mandatory listing of phosphorus content on product labels. Organizations such as the American Society of Nephrology and the National Kidney Foundation have taken action to advocate for this labeling, but their efforts have been unsuccessful to date.\"",

Therefore, people with kidney disease need to carefully monitor their phosphorus intake. Excess phosphorus in the blood could also disrupt calcium metabolism and bone mineralization, which could lead to osteoporosis. It is also suspected of promoting vascular calcification, which is associated with increased cardiovascular mortality. In addition, phosphates from inorganic food additives are more easily absorbed and may have more adverse effects on cardiovascular health than those naturally present in food.\n\nStudies conducted in 2023 and 2024 by the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM) also suggest direct associations between high intakes of some phosphate additives and an increased risk of some chronic diseases. These studies observed a 77% increase in the risk of breast cancer (in premenopausal women) for diphosphates, a 15% increase in the risk of type 2 diabetes for potassium phosphate, and a 6% increase in the risk of coronary heart disease for sodium phosphate. However, INSERM concluded that further research is required to confirm these correlations.\n\nIn 2019, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) determined that phosphate intake could exceed the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) in infants, children, and adolescents with a high phosphate diet. In addition, vulnerable patients with kidney disease, which affects 10% of the general population, may not be able to tolerate the ADI. EFSA also concluded that current evidence was insufficient to establish a clear link between excess dietary phosphorus and cardiovascular disease and therefore, further studies were recommended. It is important to note that this opinion does not consider the previously mentioned 2024 Inserm study, which provides new perspectives. \n\nIn the United States, phosphate additives are substances that have been \u201cgenerally recognized as safe\u201d (GRAS) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) since the 1970s. Under US regulations, their use is limited in certain product categories: industrial and acidified cheeses and milk, baked goods, ice cream, jams, and cocoa products. There is no maximum allowable quantity for the other product categories.\n\nBetween 2014 and 2016, several initiatives were launched in the United States to urge the FDA to require the mandatory listing of phosphorus content on product labels. Organizations such as the American Society of Nephrology and the National Kidney Foundation have taken action to advocate for this labeling, but their efforts have been unsuccessful to date.\"",

      "\"E210_long_description\" : \"Benzoic acid and its salts (sodium benzoate and potassium benzoate) are preservatives mainly found in sodas, fruit juices, and sauces. They are used for controlling microorganisms and preventing food oxidation.\n\nOne of the concerns regarding this additive lies in its potential to form benzene when combined with ascorbic acid (in the form of natural vitamin C or as an additive). Benzene is classified as a carcinogen for humans (Group 1) by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). This risk of a potentially dangerous chemical interaction underscores the importance of carefully monitoring ingredients in food products that combine these two compounds, particularly flavored soft drinks. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) noted this interaction in its 2016 opinion. It recommended considering the formulation and storage conditions of soft drinks to minimize benzene formation, as higher storage temperatures can contribute to this formation.\n\nAnother concern about this additive is the potential risk of exceeding the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) in children. According to the 2016 EFSA opinion, young children who are heavy consumers of foods containing this additive, particularly flavored drinks, could exceed the ADI. Additionally, as early as 1974, the World Health Organization (WHO) established an ADI of 5 mg/kg body weight/day, based on studies that revealed reprotoxic effects (toxic effects on reproduction) in rats.\n\nMore recently, a 2020 study reinforced concerns about this additive, showing that it could disrupt sperm formation and function, as well as sex hormone levels. That same year, other research highlighted toxic effects on blood and the immune system after prolonged exposure to doses close to the ADI. Furthermore, studies conducted in 2021 and 2023 observed signs of renal and hepatic toxicity in rats.\n\nThe EFSA also indicated in 2016 that this additive could increase hypersensitivity and provoke skin reactions. Various cases of intolerance to benzoic acid and its salts have been reported in scientific literature, including skin reactions, gastrointestinal disorders, bronchial hyperreactivity, asthma attacks, and effects on the central nervous system. These reactions can occur even at doses lower than the ADI in individuals sensitive to benzoate.\n\nThis preservative is also suspected of contributing to hyperactivity and attention deficit disorders in children when combined with certain colorants. However, the EFSA ruled out this risk in its 2008 and 2016 re-evaluations. The EFSA acknowledges that the results of the main incriminating study show a real impact on some individuals particularly sensitive to food additives and/or colorants. However, the EFSA expert committee emphasizes that these results cannot be generalized to the entire population.\n\nFinally, the EFSA recommends revising the maximum limits for toxic element impurities (lead, mercury, and arsenic) related to benzoic acid and its salts to ensure that additives do not become a significant source of exposure to these toxic elements.\n\nIn the United States, this preservative is part of the \u201cGenerally Recognized as Safe\u201d (GRAS) substances by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), but its use and dosage are limited based on product categories. This additive was approved by the FDA in 1973, which has not published a new opinion since, taking into account more recent studies on this additive.\"",

Patent blue V is authorized for use in the European Union. However, this dye is banned in several countries, including the United States, Australia, and Canada.\n\nOne of the main concerns associated with Patent Blue is the presence of aluminum in some forms of this additive. Therefore, it can contribute to our total dietary intake of aluminum, which is too high for a large part of the population, according to the 2008 scientific opinion of the EFSA (European Food Safety Authority). Although most aluminum consumed is excreted through the feces, it can accumulate in various tissues, including bone, liver, lung, kidney, and brain.\n\nThis is concerning for several reasons. Firstly, it is associated with potential adverse effects on reproduction and fetal development, according to a 2011 document from the World Health Organization (WHO). In addition, it is suspected of causing DNA damage and increasing the risk of diseases such as multiple sclerosis, asthma, autism, epilepsy, and neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease. Although aluminum levels in food products are generally below the risk threshold, the accumulation from several sources of daily exposure (food, water, cosmetics) can exceed the recommended limits according to institutions and agencies such as the WHO, EFSA, the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR), and the Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety (SCCS). In its scientific opinion of 2013, the EFSA emphasized the need to limit certain elements such as aluminum and chromium in Patent Blue, which are still not regulated in this additive.\n\nAnother concern associated with this additive is the possible presence of impurities such as aromatic amines, compounds suspected of being genotoxic, and probable carcinogens. The serious implications of these impurities are such that, in 2013, EFSA set a minimum purity level of 90% as a condition for establishing the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) of this dye. This decision is based on a 2010 study showing that, even with a lower purity level of 86%, Patent Blue could present mutagenic effects. It appears that these effects are primarily due to the impurities present in the dye.\n\nThese adverse effects are even more concerning considering the increased potential for exceeding the ADI by toddlers and young children who consume large amounts of products containing this food dye (especially milk-based drinks).\n\nIn addition, a 2013 study revealed that Patent Blue V can penetrate the bloodstream through saliva. This is of particular concern for products such as lollipops, candies, and chewing gum, which remain in contact with the tongue for long periods, increasing exposure and absorption of this dye in children, a population group already at risk of exceeding the ADI.\"",

Their use is subject to maximum dosage restrictions.\n\nSulfites may cause severe intolerance reactions (blotchy skin, dermatitis, urticaria, asthma, conjunctivitis, migraine, etc.) in sensitive or asthmatic individuals. According to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), 3-10% of people with asthma may have a sulfite intolerance. \n\nMost people with a sensitivity to sulfites develop food intolerance reactions at doses of 20-50 mg per kilogram or liter of sulfites in the food product.

      "\"E951_long_description\" : \"Aspartame is an artificial sweetener that is 150 to 200 times sweeter than sugar (sucrose). It is used in many so-called \"diet\" or sugar-free products. Aspartame is currently associated with a number of health risks:\n\nAspartame and cancer\n\nAspartame has been classified as \"possibly carcinogenic to humans\" (Group 2B) by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) since July 2023, mainly based on suspected carcinogenicity in the liver.\n\nIn particular, this IARC classification was established after the publication of a cohort study by the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM) in 2022, which showed that aspartame consumption could be associated with an increased risk of cancer in humans. The highest risks involve breast cancer (up to +22% risk) and obesity-related cancers (up to +15% risk). The study also suggests that the consumption of sweeteners may be associated with an increased risk of cancer, similar to excessive sugar consumption. The scientists who conducted the study therefore \"do not advise using artificial sweeteners as safe substitutes for sugar in foods and beverages.\" They also point out that the participants' aspartame consumption was below the acceptable daily intake (ADI). However, the research team conducting this cancer study highlights some uncertainties. Further studies are therefore required at this stage to confirm this correlation.\n\nPrevious studies conducted between 2010 and 2012 showed that aspartame consumption at the usual doses could increase the occurrence of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (cancers of the lymphatic system) and myeloma (bone marrow cancers) in humans. Moreover, at very high doses, an increased incidence of liver cancer and lung cancer has been observed in male mice.\n\nAt the same time, many authorities consider that aspartame poses no health risks in the quantities consumed. In a report from June 2023, the JECFA (a joint FAO/WHO committee) stated that \"there is no concern for carcinogenicity in animals from oral exposure to aspartame,\" confirming the safety of the ADI previously established in 1981. In 2013, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) concluded that \"aspartame is not a health concern.\" However, these two assessments were published before the IARC report in July 2023, which provides new evidence of the carcinogenicity of aspartame. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) disagrees with the IARC's conclusions, declaring that \"scientists do not have safety concerns when aspartame is used under the approved conditions.\"\n\nNevertheless, the protocol and industrial financing of several studies used by the authorities to reach their conclusions have been criticized for many years by various research groups. In 2016 and 2017, two different scientific journals showed that the funding of sweetener studies by the food industry may lead to biased results. Researchers in studies funded by the food industry could be more likely to conclude that sweeteners have no negative effects (particularly on weight) than those in independent studies.\n\nMoreover, scientists from the French Health & Environment Network (RES), an NGO dedicated to promoting public health, denounced back in 2013 that \"several members of the EFSA have a conflict of interest, in particular due to their work for the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI), which lobbies for the food industry.\" Similarly, a scientific review published in July 2019 by two researchers at the University of Sussex in the United Kingdom also challenged the EFSA's position. The authors pointed out that the EFSA excluded 73 studies demonstrating the harmful effects of aspartame from its findings, while most of the studies showing insufficient evidence were included in the analysis. According to these researchers, the majority of the 73 excluded studies were more reliable than those that found no risks. The authors suggested that the EFSA may have been influenced by commercial conflicts of interest. They therefore called for an independent re-evaluation to be conducted in Europe.\n\nAspartame and diabetes\n\nIn 2023, an INSERM cohort study showed that aspartame increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 48 to 63%. According to other studies, sweeteners may affect the intestinal flora and lead to metabolic disorders, particularly glucose intolerance (a common precursor to type 2 diabetes).\n\nAspartame and cardiovascular disease\n\nA 2022 cohort study by the INSERM showed that the consumption of aspartame could be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and more specifically cerebrovascular disease (+17% risk).\n\nRead more: https://help.yuka.io/article/r2x5e36paq\"",

Many types of food contain phosphates, including baked goods, processed meat, and dairy products.\n\nPhosphates contain phosphorus, a chemical element essential for many biological processes. Notably, it is involved in many of the body's biochemical reactions, as well as in bone mineral density. Therefore, a recommended dietary allowance (RDA) has been established for phosphorous. Phosphorus is naturally present in animal-based and plant-based products. However, according to the 2015 opinion of the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety. (ANSES), phosphorus intakes in Europe are 2 to 3 times greater than the RDA, primarily due to the widespread use of phosphate food additives and the high consumption of meat and dairy products. National surveys in the United States conducted from 2015-2016 show a similar trend: Americans consume 1.5 to 3 times the RDA of phosphorous, depending on their age group. In addition, scientific reviews from 2013 and 2019 indicate that phosphorus intakes in the United States are underestimated by more than 20% in nutrition databases. This underestimation could be exacerbated by the increase in the use of fast-food and away-from-home establishments, where nutritional information is often missing or incomplete. \n\nAccording to several studies conducted between 2012 and 2023, excessive dietary phosphorus intake can cause many health problems. It may be directly harmful to the kidneys because when the kidneys' capacity to filter out excess phosphorus is exceeded, it can accumulate in the blood. Therefore, people with kidney disease need to carefully monitor their phosphorus intake.

These studies observed a 77% increase in the risk of breast cancer (in premenopausal women) for diphosphates, a 15% increase in the risk of type 2 diabetes for potassium phosphate, and a 6% increase in the risk of coronary heart disease for sodium phosphate. However, INSERM concluded that further research is required to confirm these correlations.\n\nIn 2019, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) determined that phosphate intake could exceed the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) in infants, children, and adolescents with a high phosphate diet. In addition, vulnerable patients with kidney disease, which affects 10% of the general population, may not be able to tolerate the ADI. EFSA also concluded that current evidence was insufficient to establish a clear link between excess dietary phosphorus and cardiovascular disease and therefore, further studies were recommended.

      "\"E343iii_long_description\" : \"Phosphates have several functions: leavening agents, stabilizers, acidity regulators, and humectants. Many types of food contain phosphates, including baked goods, processed meat, and dairy products.\n\nPhosphates contain phosphorus, a chemical element essential for many biological processes. Notably, it is involved in many of the body's biochemical reactions, as well as in bone mineral density. Therefore, a recommended dietary allowance (RDA) has been established for phosphorous. Phosphorus is naturally present in animal-based and plant-based products. However, according to the 2015 opinion of the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety. (ANSES), phosphorus intakes in Europe are 2 to 3 times greater than the RDA, primarily due to the widespread use of phosphate food additives and the high consumption of meat and dairy products. National surveys in the United States conducted from 2015-2016 show a similar trend: Americans consume 1.5 to 3 times the RDA of phosphorous, depending on their age group. In addition, scientific reviews from 2013 and 2019 indicate that phosphorus intakes in the United States are underestimated by more than 20% in nutrition databases. This underestimation could be exacerbated by the increase in the use of fast-food and away-from-home establishments, where nutritional information is often missing or incomplete. \n\nAccording to several studies conducted between 2012 and 2023, excessive dietary phosphorus intake can cause many health problems. It may be directly harmful to the kidneys because when the kidneys' capacity to filter out excess phosphorus is exceeded, it can accumulate in the blood. Therefore, people with kidney disease need to carefully monitor their phosphorus intake. Excess phosphorus in the blood could also disrupt calcium metabolism and bone mineralization, which could lead to osteoporosis. It is also suspected of promoting vascular calcification, which is associated with increased cardiovascular mortality. In addition, phosphates from inorganic food additives are more easily absorbed and may have more adverse effects on cardiovascular health than those naturally present in food.\n\nStudies conducted in 2023 and 2024 by the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM) also suggest direct associations between high intakes of some phosphate additives and an increased risk of some chronic diseases. These studies observed a 77% increase in the risk of breast cancer (in premenopausal women) for diphosphates, a 15% increase in the risk of type 2 diabetes for potassium phosphate, and a 6% increase in the risk of coronary heart disease for sodium phosphate. However, INSERM concluded that further research is required to confirm these correlations.\n\nIn 2019, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) determined that phosphate intake could exceed the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) in infants, children, and adolescents with a high phosphate diet. In addition, vulnerable patients with kidney disease, which affects 10% of the general population, may not be able to tolerate the ADI. EFSA also concluded that current evidence was insufficient to establish a clear link between excess dietary phosphorus and cardiovascular disease and therefore, further studies were recommended. It is important to note that this opinion does not consider the previously mentioned 2024 Inserm study, which provides new perspectives. \n\nIn the United States, phosphate additives are substances that have been \u201cgenerally recognized as safe\u201d (GRAS) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) since the 1970s. Under US regulations, their use is limited in certain product categories: industrial and acidified cheeses and milk, baked goods, ice cream, jams, and cocoa products. There is no maximum allowable quantity for the other product categories.\n\nBetween 2014 and 2016, several initiatives were launched in the United States to urge the FDA to require the mandatory listing of phosphorus content on product labels. Organizations such as the American Society of Nephrology and the National Kidney Foundation have taken action to advocate for this labeling, but their efforts have been unsuccessful to date.\"",

      "\"E250_long_description\" : \"Nitrites are preservatives extensively used in the food industry, particularly in processed meat products. These additives are added to meat products to extend shelf life, maintain color, and enhance flavor. However, nitrites have been associated with various toxic effects on human health.\n\nWhen added to meat, nitrites can form a group of compounds known as nitrosamines, some of which are classified as \u201cprobably carcinogenic to humans\u201d by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and as genotoxic (capable of altering cellular DNA) by the French National Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health Safety (ANSES). In 2010, IARC also classified nitrites as \u201cprobably carcinogenic to humans\u201d (Group 2A) when ingested under conditions favorable to the formation of nitrosamines. The 2023 report by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) stated that exposure to nitrosamines in food, particularly meat products, \u201craises a public health concern\u201d. It concluded that all age groups are affected by a significant exceedance of safe levels and the increased risk of developing cancer. \n\nAccording to the 2017 EFSA report, studies have shown some evidence linking the combination of nitrite plus nitrate from processed meat and colorectal cancer. A positive association between the dietary intake of nitrites and gastric cancer risk was also suggested. In its 2022 report, ANSES confirmed a positive association between exposure to nitrates and/or nitrites and the risk of colorectal cancer. A suspected correlation was also observed with other types of cancer (breast, bladder, pancreatic, stomach, esophageal, prostate), as well as an increased risk of cancer mortality.\n\nFurthermore, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), nitrites can convert the hemoglobin in blood into methemoglobin, causing a condition known as methemoglobinemia, which impairs the ability of red blood cells to deliver oxygen throughout the body. The WHO also states that infants and the elderly are at greater risk of developing methemoglobinemia. A 2021 publication goes as far as to affirm that nitrites used as preservatives in foods are potential \u201ctriggering agents\u201d for this disease. Other susceptible individuals include adults with a genetic predisposition, those suffering from peptic ulcers, chronic gastritis or renal failure, and dialysis patients.\n\nThe JECFA (Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives) established an acceptable daily intake (ADI) in 2002 to avoid the risk of adverse effects on the blood and also reported that \u201ceffects on the heart and lungs\u201d had been observed in rats.\n\nIn 2017, the EFSA stated that certain consumers are at risk of exceeding the ADI established in Europe (very close to the limit set by the WHO), which would expose them to a health hazard, but decided to maintain the current ADI. This is even more worrisome considering that the ADI does not fully take account of the risks associated with the formation of nitrosated compounds. \n\nBased on the ANSES recommendations, which called for a reduction in the use of nitrate additives as part of a \u201chealth safety objective\u201d approach, on March 27, 2023, the French government announced an \u201cAction plan to reduce the use of nitrite/nitrate additives in food\u201d. The plan sets out a three-stage trajectory for the reduction or elimination of nitrite/nitrate additives in food.\n\nIn the United States, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has permitted the use of nitrites in meat products since 1906. They were subsequently approved for use in tuna and salmon at maximum doses defined by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). However, these limits are more lenient than European regulations, where allowable levels are 2 to 4 times lower, particularly in meat products.\"",

During the process, brominated fatty acids form. This additive is banned in many countries (including the countries of Europe) but approved for use in the United States and Canada, where it is found in certain soft drinks.\n\nBromine compounds have been suspected to be carcinogenic, neurotoxic, and genotoxic. Several cases of bromine poisoning by way of soft drinks have been reported in the United States.\n \nBrominated vegetable oils were designated as \"GRAS\" (Generally Recognized As Safe) in the United States as early as 1958, but this status was revoked in the 1970s.

These effects were taken into account in the last Scientific Committee for Food (SCF) report in 2000 on the safety of cyclamates, and to establish the ADI at 7 mg/kg body weight/day.\n\nIn 2015, the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety (ANSES) found a \"lack of nutritional benefit\" for the consumption of intense sweeteners. Its research demonstrated no effect, whether positive or negative, of intense sweeteners on weight control. The ANSES also recommends studying the possible interactions between body size, consumption of intense sweeteners and weight gain. More broadly, the issue of nutritional risks linked to consumption of sweeteners remains unclear. Moreover, some recent data suggests a link between consumption of sweeteners and weight gain. \n\nAccording to a 2020 study, cyclamate supplementation may lead to weight gain and higher food intake.\n\nIn addition, a 2019 in vitro study suggests that cyclamates may be toxic to bone cells.\n\nIn general, sweeteners may also disturb the intestinal flora and promote metabolic disorders, particularly the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. In addition, a study by the French National Institute for Health and Medical Research (Inserm) demonstrated that diet beverages are associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes.\n\nFinally, two Inserm (French National Institute of Health and Medical Research) studies published in 2022 suggest an association between the overall consumption of sweeteners and an increased risk of cancer and cardiovascular disease Cyclamates were among the sweeteners studied in these two analyses, through a cumulative consumption with other sweeteners.\"",

      "\"E110_long_description\" : \"Sunset Yellow FCF is a dye used in products such as flavored drinks, snacks and cookies, tortilla chips, breakfast cereals, and candies.\n\nFirst of all, this coloring is suspected of promoting hyperactivity and attention deficit disorders in children when combined with sodium benzoate, according to a 2007 study. In 2009, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) downplayed the conclusions of this study by citing a lack of substantial evidence of causality. In particular, the EFSA emphasized the fact that a mixture of dyes was used in this study, making it impossible to determine whether the effects were specifically attributable to this dye, to another dye, or to the mixture. The EFSA therefore considered that it was not necessary to revise the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI). In 2010, following the incriminating 2007 study, the European Commission decided to tighten the regulations: foods containing this additive must be labeled \u201cMay have adverse effects on activity and attention in children.\u201d\n\nIn 2011, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the United States reviewed the incriminating 2007 study in response to a petition from the Center for Science in the Public Interest calling for a ban on certain artificial food dyes. Like the EFSA, the experts concluded that the study did not prove causality between the dyes and attention deficit disorder with or without hyperactivity (ADHD) in children. The FDA determined that mandatory labeling, like that used in Europe, was not required.\n\nIn 2012, a scientific review and meta-analysis of over 20 studies concluded that artificial food colors are not a major cause of ADHD per se but may significantly contribute to some cases. The researchers also suggest that the deleterious effect of artificial dyes does not appear to be confined to ADHD and could be a more general health problem. They point out that evidence of the impact of food colors on children's behavior is inconclusive but \u201ctoo substantial to dismiss\u201d. Pending further research, the researchers recommend caution and limiting children's exposure to artificial colors, whose use has quadrupled in the USA over the past 50 years.\n\nA 2022 study focusing solely on the effect of Sunset Yellow also revealed adverse effects on the nervous system in rats. Neurobehavioral disorders, such as increased anxiety and loss of spatial memory, were observed, but at high doses exceeding the ADI.\n\nThis additive could also adversely affect fertility and reproduction with chronic daily exposure. Adverse effects on the male genital organs have been observed at low doses in rats, leading to a change in European regulations in 2012 to limit the maximum permitted level in many products. However, these effects were called into question by a 2014 EFSA report, which increased the ADI. A 2016 in vitro study also revealed that this dye could induce morphological sperm abnormalities and impact DNA.\n\nFurthermore, studies conducted between 2022 and 2024 have highlighted the negative effects of this dye on gut microbiota, notably through the production of certain probable genotoxic and carcinogenic substances (aromatic amines) during digestion.\n\nAccording to the 2010 opinion of the EFSA, Sunset Yellow could also trigger intolerance reactions in sensitive individuals.\n\nLastly, this dye may contain impurities of concern, notably Sudan I, suspected of being carcinogenic. It has been banned as an additive in the European Union since 1995, and regulations impose strict limits to minimize its presence. However, it can still develop during the Sunset Yellow manufacturing process and can therefore be found in the finished product. \nIn the United States, this dye has an ADI close to that of the EU. This limit was set in 1986 and has not since been updated to take account of more recent studies. Two scientific reviews from 2021 and 2022, conducted by American public health research centers, concluded that the current ADI is not adequate. The researchers recommended re-evaluating exposure to this dye in children and conducting further research to establish ADIs that provide more protection against adverse neurobehavioral effects.\n\nHowever, starting in 2028, this dye, along with five others, will be banned in public schools in California.\"",

      "\"E450v_long_description\" : \"Phosphates have several functions: leavening agents, stabilizers, acidity regulators, and humectants. Many types of food contain phosphates, including baked goods, processed meat, and dairy products.\n\nPhosphates contain phosphorus, a chemical element essential for many biological processes. Notably, it is involved in many of the body's biochemical reactions, as well as in bone mineral density. Therefore, a recommended dietary allowance (RDA) has been established for phosphorous. Phosphorus is naturally present in animal-based and plant-based products. However, according to the 2015 opinion of the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety. (ANSES), phosphorus intakes in Europe are 2 to 3 times greater than the RDA, primarily due to the widespread use of phosphate food additives and the high consumption of meat and dairy products. National surveys in the United States conducted from 2015-2016 show a similar trend: Americans consume 1.5 to 3 times the RDA of phosphorous, depending on their age group. In addition, scientific reviews from 2013 and 2019 indicate that phosphorus intakes in the United States are underestimated by more than 20% in nutrition databases. This underestimation could be exacerbated by the increase in the use of fast-food and away-from-home establishments, where nutritional information is often missing or incomplete. \n\nAccording to several studies conducted between 2012 and 2023, excessive dietary phosphorus intake can cause many health problems. It may be directly harmful to the kidneys because when the kidneys' capacity to filter out excess phosphorus is exceeded, it can accumulate in the blood. Therefore, people with kidney disease need to carefully monitor their phosphorus intake. Excess phosphorus in the blood could also disrupt calcium metabolism and bone mineralization, which could lead to osteoporosis. It is also suspected of promoting vascular calcification, which is associated with increased cardiovascular mortality. In addition, phosphates from inorganic food additives are more easily absorbed and may have more adverse effects on cardiovascular health than those naturally present in food.\n\nStudies conducted in 2023 and 2024 by the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM) also suggest direct associations between high intakes of some phosphate additives and an increased risk of some chronic diseases. These studies observed a 77% increase in the risk of breast cancer (in premenopausal women) for diphosphates, a 15% increase in the risk of type 2 diabetes for potassium phosphate, and a 6% increase in the risk of coronary heart disease for sodium phosphate. However, INSERM concluded that further research is required to confirm these correlations.\n\nIn 2019, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) determined that phosphate intake could exceed the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) in infants, children, and adolescents with a high phosphate diet. In addition, vulnerable patients with kidney disease, which affects 10% of the general population, may not be able to tolerate the ADI. EFSA also concluded that current evidence was insufficient to establish a clear link between excess dietary phosphorus and cardiovascular disease and therefore, further studies were recommended. It is important to note that this opinion does not consider the previously mentioned 2024 Inserm study, which provides new perspectives. \n\nIn the United States, phosphate additives are substances that have been \u201cgenerally recognized as safe\u201d (GRAS) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) since the 1970s. Under US regulations, their use is limited in certain product categories: industrial and acidified cheeses and milk, baked goods, ice cream, jams, and cocoa products. There is no maximum allowable quantity for the other product categories.\n\nBetween 2014 and 2016, several initiatives were launched in the United States to urge the FDA to require the mandatory listing of phosphorus content on product labels. Organizations such as the American Society of Nephrology and the National Kidney Foundation have taken action to advocate for this labeling, but their efforts have been unsuccessful to date.\"",

Unlike intense sweeteners, bulk sweeteners have less sweetening power than sugar (sucrose). Sorbitol is naturally present in certain fruits and has half the sweetening power of sugar (sucrose). In the industry, it is derived from starch (most often corn starch). It can also be used for its texture properties, to thicken or stabilize products. Moreover, sorbitol is found naturally in apples, pears, peaches, and apricots.\n\nIn the event of heavy consumption, sorbitol may cause digestive issues (diarrhea, bloating, flatulence). As a result, foodstuffs containing more than 10% sorbitol must bear the statement, \"Excess consumption may have a laxative effect.\" Moreover, sorbitol is prohibited for use in beverages and baby products.\n\nGenerally speaking, sweeteners may also disrupt the intestinal flora and promote metabolic disorders, particularly the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Although sorbitol and other bulk sweeteners lead to a better glycemic response than sugar, few studies have been conducted on their impact on the intestinal flora, weight gain, or the risk of type 2 diabetes.\n\nThe European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has planned to re-evaluate bulk and intense sweeteners by December 2020. In connection with this, it launched appeals for toxicological (2017) and compositional data (2018) from the industry. Sorbitol will be re-evaluated in light of these new data.\"",

      "\"E226_long_description\" : \"This additive is a sulfite, a sulfur-based compound. Sulfites are used as preservatives (they prevent the development of bacteria and mold) and as antioxidants (they keep products from oxidizing and losing their color). They are often found in wine and in many industrial products (dried fruit, mustard, etc.). Their use is subject to maximum dosage restrictions.\n\nSulfites may cause severe intolerance reactions (blotchy skin, dermatitis, urticaria, asthma, conjunctivitis, migraine, etc.) in sensitive or asthmatic individuals. According to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), 3-10% of people with asthma may have a sulfite intolerance. \n\nMost people with a sensitivity to sulfites develop food intolerance reactions at doses of 20-50 mg per kilogram or liter of sulfites in the food product. As a result, European law requires that sulfites be declared on food labels if their concentration is equal to or greater than 10 mg/kg or 10 mg/L.\n\nIn 2011, a study by the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety (ANSES) found that 2.9% of French adults exceeded the ADI (Acceptable Daily Intake), corresponding to specific groups (heavy consumers of wine, for example). Those data from 2011 have not been updated by ANSES since.\n\nIn a new opinion issued in 2016, the EFSA found that the current safety level ensured sufficient consumer protection. However, the EFSA also acknowledged that the ADI for sulfites may be exceeded by all age groups and indicated that this is a temporary ADI. The EFSA therefore recommended that the ADI be re-evaluated by 2021, following new studies that will take at least 5 years to conduct. The EFSA also recommends that the exact quantity of sulfites be shown on food packaging, in addition to the \"contains sulfites\" label.\"",

      "\"E451ii_long_description\" : \"Phosphates have several functions: leavening agents, stabilizers, acidity regulators, and humectants. Many types of food contain phosphates, including baked goods, processed meat, and dairy products.\n\nPhosphates contain phosphorus, a chemical element essential for many biological processes. Notably, it is involved in many of the body's biochemical reactions, as well as in bone mineral density. Therefore, a recommended dietary allowance (RDA) has been established for phosphorous. Phosphorus is naturally present in animal-based and plant-based products. However, according to the 2015 opinion of the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety. (ANSES), phosphorus intakes in Europe are 2 to 3 times greater than the RDA, primarily due to the widespread use of phosphate food additives and the high consumption of meat and dairy products. National surveys in the United States conducted from 2015-2016 show a similar trend: Americans consume 1.5 to 3 times the RDA of phosphorous, depending on their age group. In addition, scientific reviews from 2013 and 2019 indicate that phosphorus intakes in the United States are underestimated by more than 20% in nutrition databases. This underestimation could be exacerbated by the increase in the use of fast-food and away-from-home establishments, where nutritional information is often missing or incomplete. \n\nAccording to several studies conducted between 2012 and 2023, excessive dietary phosphorus intake can cause many health problems. It may be directly harmful to the kidneys because when the kidneys' capacity to filter out excess phosphorus is exceeded, it can accumulate in the blood. Therefore, people with kidney disease need to carefully monitor their phosphorus intake. Excess phosphorus in the blood could also disrupt calcium metabolism and bone mineralization, which could lead to osteoporosis. It is also suspected of promoting vascular calcification, which is associated with increased cardiovascular mortality. In addition, phosphates from inorganic food additives are more easily absorbed and may have more adverse effects on cardiovascular health than those naturally present in food.\n\nStudies conducted in 2023 and 2024 by the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM) also suggest direct associations between high intakes of some phosphate additives and an increased risk of some chronic diseases. These studies observed a 77% increase in the risk of breast cancer (in premenopausal women) for diphosphates, a 15% increase in the risk of type 2 diabetes for potassium phosphate, and a 6% increase in the risk of coronary heart disease for sodium phosphate. However, INSERM concluded that further research is required to confirm these correlations.\n\nIn 2019, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) determined that phosphate intake could exceed the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) in infants, children, and adolescents with a high phosphate diet. In addition, vulnerable patients with kidney disease, which affects 10% of the general population, may not be able to tolerate the ADI. EFSA also concluded that current evidence was insufficient to establish a clear link between excess dietary phosphorus and cardiovascular disease and therefore, further studies were recommended. It is important to note that this opinion does not consider the previously mentioned 2024 Inserm study, which provides new perspectives. \n\nIn the United States, phosphate additives are substances that have been \u201cgenerally recognized as safe\u201d (GRAS) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) since the 1970s. Under US regulations, their use is limited in certain product categories: industrial and acidified cheeses and milk, baked goods, ice cream, jams, and cocoa products. There is no maximum allowable quantity for the other product categories.\n\nBetween 2014 and 2016, several initiatives were launched in the United States to urge the FDA to require the mandatory listing of phosphorus content on product labels. Organizations such as the American Society of Nephrology and the National Kidney Foundation have taken action to advocate for this labeling, but their efforts have been unsuccessful to date.\"",

National surveys in the United States conducted from 2015-2016 show a similar trend: Americans consume 1.5 to 3 times the RDA of phosphorous, depending on their age group. In addition, scientific reviews from 2013 and 2019 indicate that phosphorus intakes in the United States are underestimated by more than 20% in nutrition databases. This underestimation could be exacerbated by the increase in the use of fast-food and away-from-home establishments, where nutritional information is often missing or incomplete. \n\nAccording to several studies conducted between 2012 and 2023, excessive dietary phosphorus intake can cause many health problems. It may be directly harmful to the kidneys because when the kidneys' capacity to filter out excess phosphorus is exceeded, it can accumulate in the blood. Therefore, people with kidney disease need to carefully monitor their phosphorus intake. Excess phosphorus in the blood could also disrupt calcium metabolism and bone mineralization, which could lead to osteoporosis. It is also suspected of promoting vascular calcification, which is associated with increased cardiovascular mortality. In addition, phosphates from inorganic food additives are more easily absorbed and may have more adverse effects on cardiovascular health than those naturally present in food.\n\nStudies conducted in 2023 and 2024 by the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM) also suggest direct associations between high intakes of some phosphate additives and an increased risk of some chronic diseases. These studies observed a 77% increase in the risk of breast cancer (in premenopausal women) for diphosphates, a 15% increase in the risk of type 2 diabetes for potassium phosphate, and a 6% increase in the risk of coronary heart disease for sodium phosphate. However, INSERM concluded that further research is required to confirm these correlations.\n\nIn 2019, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) determined that phosphate intake could exceed the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) in infants, children, and adolescents with a high phosphate diet. In addition, vulnerable patients with kidney disease, which affects 10% of the general population, may not be able to tolerate the ADI. EFSA also concluded that current evidence was insufficient to establish a clear link between excess dietary phosphorus and cardiovascular disease and therefore, further studies were recommended. It is important to note that this opinion does not consider the previously mentioned 2024 Inserm study, which provides new perspectives. \n\nIn the United States, phosphate additives are substances that have been \u201cgenerally recognized as safe\u201d (GRAS) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) since the 1970s. Under US regulations, their use is limited in certain product categories: industrial and acidified cheeses and milk, baked goods, ice cream, jams, and cocoa products. There is no maximum allowable quantity for the other product categories.\n\nBetween 2014 and 2016, several initiatives were launched in the United States to urge the FDA to require the mandatory listing of phosphorus content on product labels. Organizations such as the American Society of Nephrology and the National Kidney Foundation have taken action to advocate for this labeling, but their efforts have been unsuccessful to date.\"",

These additives are used in a variety of products \u2014 including baked goods such as baker's yeast, pizza dough, muffins, etc. \u2014 to improve the homogeneity and texture of dough. \n\nIn a study from 2021, this additive was found to affect human gut microbiota, in particular by promoting inflammation and causing a change in the latter's composition. Sorbitan monostearate has also been found to contribute to an increased risk of diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease.\n\nIn our bodies, sorbitan esters are broken down into sorbitol and sorbitol fatty acids. According to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), these by-products are safe: the fatty acids are used by the body, and the sorbitol is eliminated through urine and feces. Nevertheless, a study from 2017 found that a high consumption of products containing sorbitol can lead to digestive problems such as gas, bloating, and diarrhea, in particular due to sorbitol's laxative properties and its intolerance in certain people.\n\nIn 2017, the EFSA ruled out the risk of genotoxicity (a substance's ability to damage DNA), but the effects on gut microbiota were not evaluated due to a lack of studies on the subject at that time. The EFSA underscored the general lack of long-term studies which are required to better assess the chronic effects of this additive. However, it indicated that studies on the acute effects were sufficient to establish an acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 10 mg of sorbitan per day per kg of body weight. \n\nThe EFSA also stressed the need to reduce the current limits for certain toxic elements (arsenic, cadmium, lead, and mercury) present in these additives to avoid excessive dietary exposures.\n\nIn addition, the committee emphasized the lack of data on the types and usage levels of sorbitan esters, as well as analytical data on their actual presence in food products. This lack of data makes assessments of actual consumer exposure to these additives less precise and less realistic. \n\nThis additive is authorized in the United States by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration), and is subject to compliance with precise manufacturing specifications and concentration limits defined according to its use and its combination with other emulsifiers. \n\n\"",

Emulsifiers make it possible to create an emulsion of two liquids that do not mix (e.g., oil and water).\n\nIn 2023, a study by the French Institute for Health and Medical Research (INSERM) established a link between high consumption of this additive and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (up to +7%). In 2024, the same institute found evidence of a correlation between high consumption of the additive and an increased risk of cancer overall (+15%), breast cancer (+24%), and prostate cancer (+46%).\n\nSeveral studies conducted on mice and human cells between 2011 and 2024 suggest that emulsifiers in general may alter intestinal permeability and disrupt the balance of intestinal flora. Emulsifiers' potential effects on microbiota may increase the risk of developing a variety of diseases, including autoimmune diseases (e.g., Crohn's disease), allergies, inflammatory diseases, and metabolic syndrome. A 2024 study also found that mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids, in particular, have a negative effect on the composition of intestinal microbiota and may increase the risk of inflammation. \n\nFurthermore, the additive may become contaminated, particularly during its manufacturing process. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) states in its 2021 report that exposure to impurities, some of which are carcinogenic and genotoxic, is more than a mere health concern. Consumers may also be exposed to substantial amounts of heavy metals. On the EFSA's recommendation, European regulations were amended in July 2023 to reduce the presence of these contaminants. The new requirements apply only in the European Union, which means that unhealthy concentrations of toxic contaminants may be present in products sold outside the European Union.\n\nNevertheless, the EFSA concluded in its scientific opinions issued between 2017 and 2021 that there is no reason to be concerned about the safety of this additive. \n\nIn the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has listed the additive as a \"generally recognized as safe\" (GRAS) substance since 1989, and there are no restrictions on its use in food products.

Many types of food contain phosphates, including baked goods, processed meat, and dairy products.\n\nPhosphates contain phosphorus, a chemical element essential for many biological processes. Notably, it is involved in many of the body's biochemical reactions, as well as in bone mineral density. Therefore, a recommended dietary allowance (RDA) has been established for phosphorous. Phosphorus is naturally present in animal-based and plant-based products. However, according to the 2015 opinion of the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety. (ANSES), phosphorus intakes in Europe are 2 to 3 times greater than the RDA, primarily due to the widespread use of phosphate food additives and the high consumption of meat and dairy products. National surveys in the United States conducted from 2015-2016 show a similar trend: Americans consume 1.5 to 3 times the RDA of phosphorous, depending on their age group. In addition, scientific reviews from 2013 and 2019 indicate that phosphorus intakes in the United States are underestimated by more than 20% in nutrition databases. This underestimation could be exacerbated by the increase in the use of fast-food and away-from-home establishments, where nutritional information is often missing or incomplete. \n\nAccording to several studies conducted between 2012 and 2023, excessive dietary phosphorus intake can cause many health problems. It may be directly harmful to the kidneys because when the kidneys' capacity to filter out excess phosphorus is exceeded, it can accumulate in the blood. Therefore, people with kidney disease need to carefully monitor their phosphorus intake. Excess phosphorus in the blood could also disrupt calcium metabolism and bone mineralization, which could lead to osteoporosis. It is also suspected of promoting vascular calcification, which is associated with increased cardiovascular mortality. In addition, phosphates from inorganic food additives are more easily absorbed and may have more adverse effects on cardiovascular health than those naturally present in food.\n\nStudies conducted in 2023 and 2024 by the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM) also suggest direct associations between high intakes of some phosphate additives and an increased risk of some chronic diseases. These studies observed a 77% increase in the risk of breast cancer (in premenopausal women) for diphosphates, a 15% increase in the risk of type 2 diabetes for potassium phosphate, and a 6% increase in the risk of coronary heart disease for sodium phosphate. However, INSERM concluded that further research is required to confirm these correlations.\n\nIn 2019, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) determined that phosphate intake could exceed the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) in infants, children, and adolescents with a high phosphate diet. In addition, vulnerable patients with kidney disease, which affects 10% of the general population, may not be able to tolerate the ADI. EFSA also concluded that current evidence was insufficient to establish a clear link between excess dietary phosphorus and cardiovascular disease and therefore, further studies were recommended. It is important to note that this opinion does not consider the previously mentioned 2024 Inserm study, which provides new perspectives. \n\nIn the United States, phosphate additives are substances that have been \u201cgenerally recognized as safe\u201d (GRAS) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) since the 1970s. Under US regulations, their use is limited in certain product categories: industrial and acidified cheeses and milk, baked goods, ice cream, jams, and cocoa products. There is no maximum allowable quantity for the other product categories.\n\nBetween 2014 and 2016, several initiatives were launched in the United States to urge the FDA to require the mandatory listing of phosphorus content on product labels. Organizations such as the American Society of Nephrology and the National Kidney Foundation have taken action to advocate for this labeling, but their efforts have been unsuccessful to date.\"",

      "\"E407_long_description\" : \"Carrageenans are red seaweed extracts used as additives for their thickening and gelling properties.\n\nIn February 2024, a study by the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM) found that high intakes of carrageenans can lead to an increased risk of breast cancer (+28\u201332%). The research team points out that the carrageenan consumption of all the participants was below the acceptable daily intake (ADI) established by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA).\n\nThe EFSA states in its 2018 report that carrageenans used in European Union food products do not always comply with current standards. Some forms of carrageenan (low-molecular-weight carrageenan) could therefore exceed the limits set by European regulations. These forms of carrageenan are suspected of being associated with a number of potential risks, such as the development of colitis, ulcers, colon lesions, and tumors. Other studies performed on rats, however, showed no effect on the development of colon cancer. It should be noted that studies do not always specify the carrageenans used or whether they are low-molecular-weight carrageenans. For this reason, the EFSA states that more information is required, particularly on the chemical composition of carrageenans, to determine whether the use of this additive poses a health risk.\n\nFurthermore, some texturizing agents, such as carrageenans, have been linked to severe disruptions of the intestinal microbiota, leading to chronic gut inflammation. This persistent inflammation weakens the immune system, and according to several recent studies, this could contribute to the onset of chronic diseases like type II diabetes, cancer, and obesity. Infants and young children should be given special consideration because their immature intestines may be more vulnerable to carrageenan's inflammatory effects. For this reason, the World Health Organization (WHO) has advised against the inclusion of carrageenans in infant formulas for children up to 12 months.\n\nAccording to the EFSA's 2018 report, exposure to this additive may exceed the ADI by up to tenfold in certain scenarios, raising public health concerns. Given the lack of data, the agency deemed this ADI\u2014set at 75 mg per kilogram of body weight\u2014to be provisional and recommended that the additive be further researched within five years of the opinion's publication. There have been no new EFSA opinions published to date. In the United States, there could also be an exceedance of the level of health concern. According to a 2016 publication by The Cornucopia Institute, a U.S. nonprofit watchdog group, the amount of carrageenan in foods is sufficient to cause inflammation.\n\nIn the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has listed the substance as \"generally recognized as safe\" (GRAS) since 1973. Nonetheless, the report's conclusions suggest that additional research is necessary to rule out potential health risks. The FDA has not issued a new advisory since that time, considering more recent studies on the additive.\"",

      "\"E452ii_long_description\" : \"Phosphates have several functions: leavening agents, stabilizers, acidity regulators, and humectants. Many types of food contain phosphates, including baked goods, processed meat, and dairy products.\n\nPhosphates contain phosphorus, a chemical element essential for many biological processes. Notably, it is involved in many of the body's biochemical reactions, as well as in bone mineral density. Therefore, a recommended dietary allowance (RDA) has been established for phosphorous. Phosphorus is naturally present in animal-based and plant-based products. However, according to the 2015 opinion of the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety. (ANSES), phosphorus intakes in Europe are 2 to 3 times greater than the RDA, primarily due to the widespread use of phosphate food additives and the high consumption of meat and dairy products. National surveys in the United States conducted from 2015-2016 show a similar trend: Americans consume 1.5 to 3 times the RDA of phosphorous, depending on their age group. In addition, scientific reviews from 2013 and 2019 indicate that phosphorus intakes in the United States are underestimated by more than 20% in nutrition databases. This underestimation could be exacerbated by the increase in the use of fast-food and away-from-home establishments, where nutritional information is often missing or incomplete. \n\nAccording to several studies conducted between 2012 and 2023, excessive dietary phosphorus intake can cause many health problems. It may be directly harmful to the kidneys because when the kidneys' capacity to filter out excess phosphorus is exceeded, it can accumulate in the blood. Therefore, people with kidney disease need to carefully monitor their phosphorus intake. Excess phosphorus in the blood could also disrupt calcium metabolism and bone mineralization, which could lead to osteoporosis. It is also suspected of promoting vascular calcification, which is associated with increased cardiovascular mortality. In addition, phosphates from inorganic food additives are more easily absorbed and may have more adverse effects on cardiovascular health than those naturally present in food.\n\nStudies conducted in 2023 and 2024 by the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM) also suggest direct associations between high intakes of some phosphate additives and an increased risk of some chronic diseases. These studies observed a 77% increase in the risk of breast cancer (in premenopausal women) for diphosphates, a 15% increase in the risk of type 2 diabetes for potassium phosphate, and a 6% increase in the risk of coronary heart disease for sodium phosphate. However, INSERM concluded that further research is required to confirm these correlations.\n\nIn 2019, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) determined that phosphate intake could exceed the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) in infants, children, and adolescents with a high phosphate diet. In addition, vulnerable patients with kidney disease, which affects 10% of the general population, may not be able to tolerate the ADI. EFSA also concluded that current evidence was insufficient to establish a clear link between excess dietary phosphorus and cardiovascular disease and therefore, further studies were recommended. It is important to note that this opinion does not consider the previously mentioned 2024 Inserm study, which provides new perspectives. \n\nIn the United States, phosphate additives are substances that have been \u201cgenerally recognized as safe\u201d (GRAS) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) since the 1970s. Under US regulations, their use is limited in certain product categories: industrial and acidified cheeses and milk, baked goods, ice cream, jams, and cocoa products. There is no maximum allowable quantity for the other product categories.\n\nBetween 2014 and 2016, several initiatives were launched in the United States to urge the FDA to require the mandatory listing of phosphorus content on product labels. Organizations such as the American Society of Nephrology and the National Kidney Foundation have taken action to advocate for this labeling, but their efforts have been unsuccessful to date.\"",

These additives are used in a variety of products \u2014 including baked goods such as baker's yeast, pizza dough, muffins, etc. \u2014 to improve the homogeneity and texture of dough. \n\nIn a study from 2021, this additive was found to affect human gut microbiota, in particular by promoting inflammation and causing a change in the latter's composition. Sorbitan monostearate has also been found to contribute to an increased risk of diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease.\n\nIn our bodies, sorbitan esters are broken down into sorbitol and sorbitol fatty acids. According to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), these by-products are safe: the fatty acids are used by the body, and the sorbitol is eliminated through urine and feces. Nevertheless, a study from 2017 found that a high consumption of products containing sorbitol can lead to digestive problems such as gas, bloating, and diarrhea, in particular due to sorbitol's laxative properties and its intolerance in certain people.\n\nIn 2017, the EFSA ruled out the risk of genotoxicity (a substance's ability to damage DNA), but the effects on gut microbiota were not evaluated due to a lack of studies on the subject at that time. The EFSA underscored the general lack of long-term studies which are required to better assess the chronic effects of this additive. However, it indicated that studies on the acute effects were sufficient to establish an acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 10 mg of sorbitan per day per kg of body weight. \n\nThe EFSA also stressed the need to reduce the current limits for certain toxic elements (arsenic, cadmium, lead, and mercury) present in these additives to avoid excessive dietary exposures.\n\nIn addition, the committee emphasized the lack of data on the types and usage levels of sorbitan esters, as well as analytical data on their actual presence in food products. This lack of data makes assessments of actual consumer exposure to these additives less precise and less realistic. \n\nThis additive is authorized in the United States by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration), and is subject to compliance with precise manufacturing specifications and concentration limits defined according to its use and its combination with other emulsifiers. \n\n\"",

      "\"E129_long_description\" : \"Allura Red is an artificial coloring used in candies, breakfast cereals, chocolates, soft and energy drinks, snacks, etc. \n\nFirst of all, this coloring is suspected of promoting hyperactivity and attention deficit disorders in children when combined with sodium benzoate, according to a 2007 study. In 2009, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) downplayed the conclusions of this study by citing a lack of substantial evidence of causality. In particular, EFSA emphasized the fact that a mixture of colorings was used in this study, making it impossible to know whether the effects were specifically attributable to this coloring, to another coloring, or to the mixture. EFSA therefore considered that it was not necessary to revise the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI). In 2010, following the incriminating 2007 study, the European Commission decided to tighten the regulations: foods containing this additive must be labeled \u201cMay have adverse effects on activity and attention in children.\u201d\n\nIn 2011, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the United States reviewed the incriminating 2007 study in response to a petition from the Center for Science in the Public Interest calling for a ban on certain artificial food colorings. Like EFSA, the experts concluded that the study did not prove causality between colorings and attention deficit disorder with or without hyperactivity (ADHD) in children. The FDA decided that mandatory labeling, such as that used in Europe, was not necessary.\n\nIn 2012, a scientific review and meta-analysis of over 20 studies concluded that artificial food colorings could contribute significantly to some cases of ADHD, even if they are not the main cause of ADHD per se. The researchers also suggest that the deleterious effect of artificial colorings goes beyond ADHD and that they could be a general public health problem. They point out that the evidence for the impact of food colorings on children's behavior is inconclusive but \"too significant to ignore.\" Pending further research, the researchers recommend caution and limiting children's exposure to artificial colorings, whose use has quadrupled in the United States over the past 50 years.\n\nA 2018 animal study focusing solely on the effects of Allura Red showed that at high doses, it could be associated with effects on the animals' nervous systems, such as impaired learning and memory. \n\nAnother point of concern is the presence of aluminum in some forms of this additive. It can thus contribute to our total aluminum intake, which is too high for a large part of the population, according to the 2008 EFSA opinion. Although aluminum is mostly eliminated from the body via the stool when ingested, it can accumulate in various tissues, such as bones, liver, lungs, kidneys, and even the brain. \n\nThis is concerning for several reasons. Firstly, it is associated with potential adverse effects on reproduction and fetal development, according to a 2011 document from the World Health Organization (WHO). On the other hand, it is suspected of causing DNA damage and increasing the risk of diseases such as multiple sclerosis, asthma, autism, epilepsy, and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Although aluminum levels in each food product are generally below the risk threshold, the accumulation from several sources of daily exposure (food, water, cosmetics) can exceed the recommended limits according to institutions and agencies such as the WHO, EFSA, the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR), and the Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety (SCCS).\n \nAccording to the 2009 EFSA opinion, this additive could also provoke hypersensitivity reactions (urticaria, asthma) in individuals sensitive to additives in general and colorings in particular, even at doses below the ADI.\n\nIn addition, studies from 2022 and 2023 highlighted the negative effects of this coloring on gut microbiota, notably through the production of certain genotoxic and probable carcinogenic substances (aromatic amines) during digestion. \n\nIn the USA, its ADI was established in 1971 by the FDA and has not been updated since to take account of more recent studies. Two scientific reviews from 2021 and 2022, conducted by American public health research centers, concluded that the current ADI could not be adequate. The researchers recommended re-evaluating exposure to this coloring in children, and conducting further research to establish ADIs that are more protective against adverse neurobehavioral effects. \n\nHowever, starting in 2028, this coloring, along with five others, will be banned in public schools in California.\"",

Additionally, phosphates from food additives are more easily absorbed and may have more detrimental effects on cardiovascular health than those naturally present in foods.\n\nStudies conducted in 2023 and 2024 by the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM) also suggest a link between high consumption of certain phosphate additives and increased risks of certain chronic diseases. These studies observed a 45% increase in premenopausal breast cancer risk for diphosphates and a 77% increase for potassium phosphate, a 15% increase in type 2 diabetes risk for potassium phosphate, and a 6% increase in coronary heart disease risk for sodium phosphate. However, INSERM states that further research is needed to confirm these correlations.\n\nThe European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) estimated in 2019 that phosphate intake could exceed the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) for infants, children, and adolescents with a diet high in phosphates. Additionally, people with kidney disease, estimated to be 10% of the population, may not tolerate the ADI due to their vulnerability. EFSA also concluded that current evidence is insufficient to establish a clear link between excess dietary phosphorus and cardiovascular diseases and recommended further studies. It is important to note that this opinion does not take into account the aforementioned 2024 INSERM study, which offers new perspectives.\nIn the United States, phosphate additives have been recognized as \u201cgenerally recognized as safe\u201d (GRAS) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) since the 1970s. According to U.S. regulations, their use is limited in certain product categories: industrial cheeses and acidified milks, bakery products, ice cream, jams, and cocoa-based products. For other product categories, there is no maximum amount to be adhered to.\n\nBetween 2014 and 2016, several initiatives were launched in the U.S. to urge the FDA to mandate phosphorus content labeling on products. Organizations such as the American Society of Nephrology and the National Kidney Foundation led various actions to demand such labeling, to no avail so far.\"",

Sulfites are used as preservatives (they prevent the development of bacteria and mold) and as antioxidants (they keep products from oxidizing and losing their color). They are often found in wine and in many industrial products (dried fruit, mustard, etc.). Their use is subject to maximum dosage restrictions.\n\nSulfites may cause severe intolerance reactions (blotchy skin, dermatitis, urticaria, asthma, conjunctivitis, migraine, etc.) in sensitive or asthmatic individuals. According to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), 3-10% of people with asthma may have a sulfite intolerance. \n\nMost people with a sensitivity to sulfites develop food intolerance reactions at doses of 20-50 mg per kilogram or liter of sulfites in the food product. As a result, European law requires that sulfites be declared on food labels if their concentration is equal to or greater than 10 mg/kg or 10 mg/L.\n\nIn 2011, a study by the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety (ANSES) found that 2.9% of French adults exceeded the ADI (Acceptable Daily Intake), corresponding to specific groups (heavy consumers of wine, for example). Those data from 2011 have not been updated by ANSES since.\n\nIn a new opinion issued in 2016, the EFSA found that the current safety level ensured sufficient consumer protection. However, the EFSA also acknowledged that the ADI for sulfites may be exceeded by all age groups and indicated that this is a temporary ADI. The EFSA therefore recommended that the ADI be re-evaluated by 2021, following new studies that will take at least 5 years to conduct. The EFSA also recommends that the exact quantity of sulfites be shown on food packaging, in addition to the \"contains sulfites\" label.\"",

However, it is classified as an emulsifier. Emulsifiers make it possible to create an emulsion of two liquids that do not mix (e.g., oil and water).\n\nIn a re-evaluation from 2018, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) deemed that this additive provided no cause for concern and that the available data did not point to any risk of genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, or reproductive toxicity. Nevertheless, this opinion does not take into account some recent, more incriminating studies regarding emulsifiers.\n\nIn 2023, a study by INSERM (the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research) found that higher intakes of cellulose (in particular, cellulose gum) can lead to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (up to +7%). Further studies are required to confirm this finding.\n\nMoreover, the EFSA did not study digestive upset or the risks of increased intestinal permeability or changes to intestinal flora, concerns raised by recent animal studies.\n\nIndeed, some studies suggest that emulsifiers modify intestinal permeability, causing intestinal barrier dysfunction. They may thus increase the risk of auto-immune disorders (such as Crohn's disease) and allergies.\n\nOther studies suggest that emulsifiers may disrupt the intestinal flora and promote inflammation, increasing the risk of inflammatory diseases and metabolic syndrome. Inflammation resulting from modification of the flora by emulsifiers may even promote the development of colon cancer, according to a recent study (Viennois, 2017).\n\nMoreover, EFSA experts have requested a review of the specifications pertaining to this additive (heavy metal and solvent residue levels, etc.). Indeed, the Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources Added to Food (ANS) noted gaps in the conclusions and recommendations in opinions published in 2018 (regarding heavy metal levels, for example). In 2023, the EFSA therefore launched a call for data. A scientific opinion is expected shortly from the EFSA that takes into account the new information.\"",

      "\"E955_long_description\" : \"Sucralose is an intense artificial sweetener that is 500 to 600 times sweeter than sugar (sucrose). It is used in many so-called \"diet\" or sugar-free products and beverages.\n\nSucralose is currently associated with a number of health risks:\n\n\u2022 Sucralose and cardiovascular disease\n\nThe French National Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM) conducted a large-scale prospective study in 2022 to investigate the correlation between the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and the consumption of artificial sweeteners, including sucralose. The study found that the total consumption of artificial sweeteners may be linked to an elevated risk of CVD, particularly cerebrovascular disease. High sucralose consumption may be associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease (+31%).\n\n\u2022 Sucralose and cancer\n\nAnother INSERM cohort study published the same year found that high sweetener consumption in general may be associated with a 13\u201314% increase in the risk of developing cancer in humans. The study also suggests that the consumption of sweeteners may be associated with an increased risk of cancer, similar to excessive sugar consumption. The scientists who conducted the study therefore \"do not advise using artificial sweeteners as safe substitutes for sugar in foods and beverages.\"\n\nThis study identified a link between high overall sweetener consumption and an increased risk of cancer, but it found no specific correlation with sucralose consumption. However, INSERM warns that this lack of a link should be interpreted with caution, as the participants in this French study consumed very little compared to the other sweeteners studied. The research team notes that sucralose consumption is very high in the United States.\n\nA 2016 study also suggested a link between oral sucralose consumption in mice and the occurrence of cancer. However, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) was asked by the European Commission to comment on the validity of the study's findings, and in its most recent opinion in 2017, the EFSA concluded that sucralose may not have carcinogenic potential.\n\n\u2022 Sucralose and chronic diseases\n\nSeveral studies published between 2014 and 2022 suggest that sweeteners may disrupt our intestinal flora and affect the mucus layer that protects our intestines from microbes. This dysregulation contributes to ongoing intestinal inflammation, weakening our immune system, and increasing the risk of developing long-term metabolic issues such as insulin resistance, glucose intolerance (a common precursor to type 2 diabetes), and weight gain.\n\nIn 2023, a cohort study conducted by INSERM on over 100,000 participants suggests that consumption of sucralose could increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 9\u201334%\n\nTwo 2018 studies also suggested thyroid effects and potential accumulation in adipose tissue.\n\nParticular care should be taken with young children and pregnant women. In fact, several recent studies have found that exposure to sucralose from an early age may permanently disrupt glucose regulation and sugar dependency. Furthermore, consuming the sweetener during pregnancy could have an effect on newborn metabolism and microbiota, according to several studies published between 2019 and 2020.\n\n\u2022 Sucralose and its effects on weight\n\nIn 2015, the French Agency for Food, Environmental, and Occupational Health & Safety (ANSES) found that \"the data is insufficient to rule on a nutritional benefit\" associated with the consumption of intense sweeteners. Its work showed that intense sweeteners played no part (positive or negative) in controlling weight.\n\nA scientific review of several studies published in 2017 goes even further, concluding that sweeteners could be \"associated with an increase in waist circumference\" and \"a higher incidence of abdominal obesity and excess weight\" over the long term.\n\nIn the United States, the additive has been authorized for use in all product categories since 1999. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers that the quantities consumed daily pose no health risk. In Europe, the most recent health risk assessment for sucralose was conducted in 2000, and it concluded that the additive was safe at the permitted doses, ruling out the risk of carcinogenicity. However, in 2010, the European Commission requested that the EFSA reassess its safety based on the latest scientific research. There have been no new EFSA opinions published to date.\"",

The research team points out that the carrageenan consumption of all the participants was below the acceptable daily intake (ADI) established by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA).\n\nThe EFSA states in its 2018 report that carrageenans used in European Union food products do not always comply with current standards. Some forms of carrageenan (low-molecular-weight carrageenan) could therefore exceed the limits set by European regulations. These forms of carrageenan are suspected of being associated with a number of potential risks, such as the development of colitis, ulcers, colon lesions, and tumors. Other studies performed on rats, however, showed no effect on the development of colon cancer. It should be noted that studies do not always specify the carrageenans used or whether they are low-molecular-weight carrageenans. For this reason, the EFSA states that more information is required, particularly on the chemical composition of carrageenans, to determine whether the use of this additive poses a health risk.\n\nFurthermore, some texturizing agents, such as carrageenans, have been linked to severe disruptions of the intestinal microbiota, leading to chronic gut inflammation. This persistent inflammation weakens the immune system, and according to several recent studies, this could contribute to the onset of chronic diseases like type II diabetes, cancer, and obesity. Infants and young children should be given special consideration because their immature intestines may be more vulnerable to carrageenan's inflammatory effects. For this reason, the World Health Organization (WHO) has advised against the inclusion of carrageenans in infant formulas for children up to 12 months.\n\nAccording to the EFSA's 2018 report, exposure to this additive may exceed the ADI by up to tenfold in certain scenarios, raising public health concerns. Given the lack of data, the agency deemed this ADI\u2014set at 75 mg per kilogram of body weight\u2014to be provisional and recommended that the additive be further researched within five years of the opinion's publication. There have been no new EFSA opinions published to date. In the United States, there could also be an exceedance of the level of health concern. According to a 2016 publication by The Cornucopia Institute, a U.S. nonprofit watchdog group, the amount of carrageenan in foods is sufficient to cause inflammation.\n\nIn the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has listed the substance as \"generally recognized as safe\" (GRAS) since 1973. Nonetheless, the report's conclusions suggest that additional research is necessary to rule out potential health risks. The FDA has not issued a new advisory since that time, considering more recent studies on the additive.\"",

However, these opinions do not take into account some recent, more incriminating studies regarding emulsifiers.\n\nIn 2023, a study by INSERM (the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research) found a direct correlation between higher intakes of mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids (in particular, derivatives of lactic acid ester and citric acid ester) and a heightened risk of cardiovascular disease (up to +11%). \n\nTests on animals suggest that emulsifiers may also affect gut microbiota and intestinal permeability.

It is used to impart a brown color to products.\n\nDuring its manufacturing process, a problematic compound forms: 4-MEI (4-methylimidazole). This substance is classified as Group 2B (\u201cpossibly carcinogenic to humans\u201d) by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). It has also been listed as a carcinogen by the State of California under its Proposition 65 \u201cSafe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986\u201d (OEHHA, 2011).\n\nResidues of this compound can be found in the caramel after production. Regulatory thresholds not to be exceeded are set in the current specifications for caramels.\n\nAdditionally, sulfites are used in the production of this additive. These compounds can trigger allergies or intolerance reactions in some individuals.\n\nIn its 2011 re-evaluation, EFSA (the European Food Safety Authority) established a group ADI (Acceptable Daily Intake) of 300 mg/kg body weight per day for the four caramel colorings (E150a, E150b, E150c, E150d).\n\nLastly, EFSA noted in its 2011 re-evaluation that other components (such as 5-HMF and furan) may be present at potentially concerning levels and recommended that specifications should include maximum concentrations for these compounds as well.\n\nIn the United States, this additive has been part of the \u201cGenerally Recognized as Safe\u201d (GRAS) substances by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) since 1973 and is not subject to any specific usage limitations in food products. No limit for possible 4-MEI contamination has been established. Since its authorization, no re-evaluation has been conducted to take recent studies on this additive into account.\"",
      "\"E520_long_description\" : \"Sodium aluminum sulfate is used as a leavening agent (to help dough rise), a firming agent (to help maintain a firm texture) and a stabilizer (to help stabilize mixtures) in a variety of products. This additive is banned in Australia. In the European Union, it is authorized only in two product categories: candied cherries and liquid egg whites. In the USA and Canada, however, it is commonly used in a wide range of bakery products, such as baking powders, tortillas and cookies.\n\nThe major concern is that this additive contributes to the total dietary intake of aluminum, which is too high for a large part of the population, according to the 2008 scientific opinion of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). Although aluminum is mostly eliminated from the body via the stool when ingested, it can accumulate in various tissues, such as bones, liver, lungs, kidneys, and even the brain.\n\nThis is concerning for several reasons. Firstly, it is associated with potential adverse effects on reproduction and fetal development, according to a 2011 document from the World Health Organization (WHO). In addition, it is suspected of causing DNA damage and increasing the risk of diseases such as multiple sclerosis, asthma, autism, epilepsy, and neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease. Although aluminum levels in each food product are generally below the risk threshold, the accumulation from several sources of daily exposure (food, water, cosmetics) can exceed the recommended limits according to several institutions and agencies such as the WHO and the EFSA.\n\nIn its 2018 opinion, the EFSA noted that the European population's exposure to aluminum sulfates is very low, mainly thanks to regulatory restrictions enacted in 2012 that limited their use to certain categories of food products. However, the EFSA has expressed concern that children, as well as heavy consumers of aluminum-containing products, may be exceeding the tolerable weekly intake (TWI) of aluminum. It therefore recommended a global assessment of aluminum exposure from all food additives to better manage health risks.\n\nIn the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has listed this additive as a \"generally recognized as safe\" (GRAS) substance, and there are no specific restrictions on its use as a food additive. The FDA has not taken a position on the risks of this additive since its approval in 1975 to take into account scientific studies published since then. A 2005 study by an American university also showed that certain baked goods that use baking powders containing aluminum salts can be sufficient to reach the tolerable weekly intake in a single serving.\n\"",
