      "\"description_ibd_git_pharma\" : \"\n - Azathioprine: a purine analogue that is converted to its active form mercaptopurine by hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl-transferase and mercaptopurine is converted to thioguinine nucleotides which incorporate into the DNA bases as false purines resulting into defective replication of immune cells followed by apoptosis, thioguinine also binds to the CD28 receptors of CD4-positive T-cells leading to decreased RAC-1 activity resulting in induced cell apoptosis. It is fairly absorbed following oral intake as less than half of the administered dose is made available and is minimally bound to plasma proteins thereby offering a high volume of distribution. It is metabolized in the liver (half life of 3-5 hours) and is excreted in urine. Adverse effects include nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, night sweats, hair loss, myelosuppression, and pancytopenia. Contraindications of this medication includes liver and kidney impairment, pre-existing neoplasia, pregnancy, and breastfeeding females. This medication is used for crohn's disease.\n\n - Infliximab: a monoclonal antibody, functions by binding to and neutralizing the cytokine TNF-alpha that is released by immune cells following insult which increases cell migration and exacerbates inflammation, infliximab also results in apoptosis of macrophages and T-cells. As it is administered intravenously therefore has rapid absorption and complete bioavailability with high volume of distribution. It is metabolized and eliminated by proteases into amino acids (half life of 8-12 days). Adverse effects include headache, visual impairment, heart failure, pneumonitis, TB reactivation in pre-existing conditions, nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, hepato-toxicity, and lymphoma. Contraindications of this medication includes multiple sclerosis, active infection, heart failure, and pre-existing TB. This medication is used for crohn's disease.\n\n - Mesalamine: acts locally on the colonic mucosa where it inhibits COX-2 and lipo-oxygenase-15 enzymes thereby preventing the formation of inflammatory cytokines, moreover, mesalamine also inhibits nuclear factor kappa-B which is responsible for the production of TNF-alpha thereby limiting the inflammation response. It is poorly absorbed following oral intake achieving low bioavailability and less than half of the available dose is bound to plasma proteins thereby offering a lesser volume of distribution. It is metabolized by the liver and gut bacteria (half life of 7-9 hours) and is excreted in urine and feces. Adverse effects include nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, myelosuppression, pancytopenia, agranulocytosis, hematuria, and interstitial nephritis. Contraindications of this medication includes liver and kidney impairment, gastrointestinal tract mechanical obstruction, mechanical obstruction of the urinary tract, phenylketonuria, pregnancy, and breastfeeding females. This medication is used for ulcerative colitis.\n\n - Sulfasalazine: a prodrug comprising of mesalamine and sulfapyridine that are broken down to their individual forms in the gut by bacterial metabolism, mesalamine exerts its effect on the colon as previously mentioned while sulfapyridine results in the adverse effects associated with sulfasalazine. It is fairly absorbed following oral intake as more than half of the administered dose is made available and is almost entirely bound to plasma proteins thereby offering a lesser volume of distribution. It is metabolized by gut bacteria (half life of 7-10 hours) and is excreted in urine. Adverse effects include headache, dizziness, difficulty sleeping, nausea and vomiting, abdominal discomfort, increased liver enzymes, hemolytic anemia, myelosuppression, pancytopenia, and oligospermia. Contraindications of this medication includes kidney impairment, gastrointestinal tract mechanical obstruction, and mechanical obstruction of the urinary tract. This medication is used for ulcerative colitis.\n\n\"",

The most important precursor trypsinogen is activated by the entrokinase enzymes present of the intestinal villi into trypsin which activates the other pancreatic proteolytic precursors.\n\n - Mechanism of action of the pancreatic proteolytic enzymes:\n \u25cf Trypsin: carries out its function by cleaving the aromatic peptides via hydrolysis of the C-terminal carboxyl side of the proteins and has a stronger affinity towards lysine and arginine.\n\n \u25cf Chymotrypsin: carries out its function through cleavage of the amide bonds of amino acids via hydrolysis by its serine active site, it has a stronger affinity towards aromatic ring-containing amino acids such as phenylalanine, tryptophan and tyrosine.\n\n \u25cf Carboxypeptidase: carries out its function by cleaving the C-terminal carboxyl side of peptides via hydrolysis, it has a stronger affinity towards arginine and lysine.\n\n \u25cf Elastase: carries out its function by cleaving the carboxyl bonds via hydrolysis, it has a stronger affinity towards valine, alanine, and glycine.\n\n\"",

It functions in relaxing the internal anal sphincter, relaxing the internal urinary sphincter, stimulate the release of secretions in the distal half of the colon, initiates and maintains erection of the penis, and promotes engorgement if the clitoris during arousal.\n\n - Lumbar plexus: arises from L1-L4 spinal nerves and gives off:\n \u25cf Ilio-hypogastric nerve: originates from the anterior branches of L1 spinal root and provides sensory innervation to the posterolateral skin of the gluteal region and skin in the pubic/supra-pubic region, It also provides motor innervation to the muscles of the abdomen.\n\n \u25cf Ilio-inguinal nerve: originates from the L1 spinal root and provides sensory innervation to the root of penis, mons pubis, the labia majora in females, and the supero-medial skin of the thigh, it also provides motor innervation to the muscles of the abdomen.\n\n \u25cf Genitofemoral nerve: originates fro the anterior branches of L1-L2 spinal nerves, it provides sensory innervation to the anterior scrotal skin, mons pubis and labia majora in females, and supero-anterior skin of the thigh, it also provides motor innervation for the cremasteric muscles in males.\n\n \u25cf Lateral cutaneous nerve of the thigh: see anatomy of the lower limb - nerves of the lower limb section.\n\n \u25cf Obturator nerve: see anatomy of the lower limb - nerves of the lower limb section.\n\n Femoral nerve: see anatomy of the lower limb - nerves of the lower limb section.\n\n - Pudendal nerve: originates from the S2-S4 spinal nerves, it is the major supplier of the perineum and genital organs. it provides innervation to the external anal sphincter (via the inferior anal nerve) and urinary sphincters. It also provides sensory innervation to the penis via the dorsal nerve of the penis and sensory innervation to the clitoris via the dorsal nerve of the clitoris.\n\n - Anococcygeal nerves: originate from the anterior spinal nerves of S4-S5 and provide sensory innervation to the anal part of the perineum.\n\n\"",
      "\"description_benign_patho_msk\" : \"\n - Osteoblastoma: is a condition characterized by the growth of a benign bone mass via the benign proliferation of osteoblasts, commonly occurring in the lower vertebra and peripheral limbs (but virtually can grow anywhere). It presents as an underlying lump associated with progressive pain and tenderness of the affected site, and nerve root compression with symptoms respectively representing the nerve involved. This condition is diagnosed by X-ray (gold-standard os MRI) showing a well-circumscribed large dense mass with thickened cortex and peripheral sclerosis along with cortical expansion, and biopsy showing a well vascularized osteoid stroma and osteoblast lined trabecula that do not invade the surrounding normal bone tissue (separated by a single layer of fibrous band). Management of this condition includes surgical resection of the tumor.\n\n - Osteoid osteoma: is a condition characterized by the growth of a benign bone mass via the benign proliferation of osteoblasts and osteoclasts, commonly occurring at the diaphysis of long bones (mostly lower limbs). It presents as an underlying lump associated with progressive pain (classically at night) and tenderness of the affected site, decreased range of motion, and inability to bear weight on the affected limb. This condition is diagnosed by X-ray (gold-standard is MRI) showing a well-circumscribed mass with central hypodensity (well-vascularized) and peripheral sclerosis associated with thickened adjacent cortex as well as the characteristic double-density sign (increased technetium uptake by the mass therefore has a more dense appearance than surrounding bone tissue) seen on the triple-phase scintigraphy.

      "\"description_ventilation_defects\" : \"\n A ventilation-perfusion defect is when an area of the lung lacks adequate ventilation, perfusion or both that is either resulting from an underlying pathology or a physiologic cause.\n\n - Types of ventilation-perfusion defects:\n \u25cf Right-left heart shunt: a condition occurring as a congenital heart defect in newborns where depending on the size of the inter-atrial defect, the blood received from the right atrium won't go through the pulmonary circulation but instead flows into the left atrium and since the blood isn't oxygenated this results in systemic hypoxemia.\n\n \u25cf High altitudes: a region of high altitude has low concentration of oxygen and a lower O2 pressure thereby making the inspired air to have reduced O2 pressure. This results in blood shifting from the dead space created by the low O2 to other areas of better ventilation and it will also result in hyperventilation since the arterial O2 is at low levels.\n\n \u25cf Pulmonary embolism: intuitively, a blood clot of the pulmonary arteries prevents the blood from reaching the capillaries for gas exchange, this creates a dead space since there is ventilation but no blood is present for the exchange of substances.\n\n \u25cf Restrictive lung disease: a classical condition of lung fibrosis where the alveoli and lung parenchyma are unable to expand and accommodate air, the alveoli lack oxygen and so blood shifts from that area to a better ventilated patch.\n\n \u25cf Exercise: though it isn't a ventilation-perfusion defect per se despite alveolar ventilation is markedly increased due to the fact that the mechanoreceptors in the joints and muscle sense the intense movement which in turn fires up the respiratory center to increase respiratory rate. An argument might arise to question if the increase in oxygen demand, the high levels of CO2 produced by the tissue, and the changes in PH would contribute to the increase ventilation and the answer is no. Although CO2 levels increase it does not reach the magnitude of pathologic acidosis.\n During exercise the cardiac output increase therefore blood flow to the pulmonary circulation increase as well resulting in less physiological dead space with adequate perfusion, although gas exchange is occurring but the high levels of CO2 decreases the affinity for O2 to bind to the hemoglobin. However, the oxygen partial pressure increases the oxygen delivered to the muscles.\n\n\"",

      "\"description_hemodynamic_regulations\" : \"\n Hemodynamic regulation requires a balance in blood flow (blood pressure) and volume, this is established by a number of the body systems such as the baroreceptor-brainstem axis, central chemoreceptors, peripheral chemoreceptors, atrial natriuretic peptide, anti-diuretic hormone, and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.\n\n - Baroreceptor-brainstem axis: the baroreceptors are sensitive to pressure and arterial stretch located in the aortic arch and the carotid sinus where they are connected to the afferent vagus and glossopharangeal nerve respectively. When blood pressure increases the vessels dilate and the baroreceptors sense this stretch in the vessel wall stimulating the vagus and glossopharyngeal nerves to carry impulses to the pons and the medulla, the impulses are then carried to the tractus solitarius nucleus where the information is integrated and an action is declared to lower the blood pressure. The NTS activates the parasympathetic system to send impulses to via the vagus nerve and decreases the activity of the sympathetic system, this reaction causes a decrease in heart rate, heart contractility, and cardiac output, the decreased activity of the sympathetic system causes vascular dilation thus lowering vascular resistance.\n\n - Central chemoreceptors: are located in the medulla and are highly sensitive to increased levels of CO2 and PH rather than blood flow. When blood flow to the brain decreases, it renders the brain ischemic causing a decrease in O2 but an increase in CO2 and PH (both aren't removed by tissue-capillary exchange due to lack of blood flow), this change in parameters causes the chemoreceptors of the medulla to activate the sympathetic system resulting in increase heart rate, contractility, vascular resistance, and cardiac output. As a consequence, other blood vessels are constricted and a larger amount of blood is being delivered to the brain.\n\n - Peripheral chemoreceptors: located in the aortic arch and carotid sinus, these receptors function in detecting lowe levels of oxygen in the blood rather than the blood volume. When O2 levels are low, this causes the respective nerves (CN-IX and CN-X) to send impulses to the nucleus of tractus solitarius which then activates the sympathetic system resulting in vasoconstriction therefore less low-oxygenated blood is sent to other organs.\n\n - Atrial natriuretic peptide: is a hormone released from the atria when there is increased blood pressure, the hormone functions in dilatation of the vessels. Due to this effect, the renal vessels dilate and promote excression of water and sodium thus lowering blood volume and pressure.\n\n - Anti-diuretic hormone: released by the posterior pituitary gland in response to decreased blood volume and increased blood osmolarity, it acts upon blood vessels and renal ducts causing vasoconstriction and increase water and salt retention, this results in increase blood volume and lowering osmolarity (see endocrine physiology - posterior pituitary gland section).\n\n - Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system: works in response to decreased blood volume that is detected by decreased renal perfusion. An enzyme in the juxtaglomerular cells called pro-renin is converted to renin when blood pressure decreases, renin then works as a catalyst for the conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin one which is then carried to the lungs to be converted by angiotensin converting enzyme to angiotensin two, angiotensin two then stimulates the kidney to release aldosterone which function in salt and water retention thereby increasing blood volume, it also stimulates the release of anti-diuretic hormone, vasoconstriction, and water intake (by acting upon the hypothalamus to stimulate thirst).\n\n\"",
      "\"description_meninges_brain\" : \"\n The meninges is a name collectively given to the three layers covering the brain and spinal cord and they are the dura mater, arachnoid mater and pia mater (pia mater being most internal and dura mater being most external).\n\n - Meninges of the brain:\n \u25cf Dura mater: it consists of two layers, the endosteal layer and the meningeal layer. The endosteal layer is the periosteum covering the inner surface of the skull and is continuous with the periosteum of the outer surface of the skull at the margins of the skull foramina. The endosteal layer is also continuous at the sutures of the skull with the sutural ligaments and is mostly adherent to the bones over the base of the skull. The meningeal layer is a dense, fibrous membrane covering the brain, that is continuous with the dura mater of the spinal cord at the foramen magnum (unlike the endosteal layer which isn't), it provides the cranial nerves with tubular sheath as they pass through the skull foramina (this sheet then becomes continuous with the epineurium of the berves outside the skull.\n\n - The meningeal layer of the dura mater forms four folds (also referred to as septa) in the cranial cavity, they prevent displacement of the brain due to forces of acceleration or deceleration during head movement. These folds are:\n \u25cf falx cerebri: a sickle-shaped fold lying between the two cerebral hemispheres with its anterior end attached to the internal frontal crest and the crista galli and its posterior end uniting with the tentorium cerebelli. At the upper margin of the falx cerebri runs the superior sagittal sinus, at its inferior margin runs the inferior sagittal sinus, and at is point of attachment with the tentorium cerebelli runs the straight sinus.\n\n \u25cf Diaphragma sellae: a circular fold forming the roof of the sella turcica, contins a central opening for the passage of the stalk of the pituitary gland.\n\n \u25cf Tentorium cerebelli: a crescent-shaped fold that lies over the posterior cranial fossa, covering the upper surface of the cerebellum and providing support to the occipital lobe of the brain as it lies above it. The tentorium cerebelli shows a gap at its anterior part, the tentorial notch, which provides passage for the midbrain.\n\n \u25cf Falx cerebelli: a sickle-shaped fold attached to the internal occipital crest and projects forward between the two cerebellar hemispheres with its posterior margin containing the occipital sinus.\n\n - Arachnoid mater: an impermeable membrane that lies between the dura mater and the pia mater and is separated from the dura mater by the subdural space (contains a thin film of fluid) and is separated from the pia mater by the subarachnoid space (contains CSF). The arachnoid mater along with the pia mater bridge over the sulci of the brain and in certain areas they both widely separate to form the subarachnoid cisternae and they are the cisterna cerebellomedullaris which is situated between the roof of the fourth ventricle and the inferior surface of the cerebellum, and the cisterna interpeduncularis which is situated between the two cerebral peduncles. The arachnoid mater also projects into the venous sisuses to form the arachnoid villi. All structures entering or leaving the brain through the skull foramina must pass through the subarachnoid space as the cerebral arteries and veins as well as the cranial nerves lie in this space. The arachnoid is associated with nerves in a way that it fuses with their epineurium as they leave the skull, especially with the optic nerve as it forms the nerve's sheath and extends along with the nerve into the orbital cavity where the nerve fuses with the sclera.\n\n - Pia mater: a vascular membrane with its outer surface covered by flat mesothelial cells, lies in direct contact with the brain as it covers the gyri and descends deep into the sulci where it fuses with the epineurium of the cranial nerves, it also forms a sheath around the cerebral arteries as they enter the brain. The tela choroidea of the roof of the third and fourth ventricles is formed by the pia mater, the pia mater also fuses with the ependyma in order to form the choroid plexus of the ventricles of the brain.\n\n - Meninges of the spinal cord:\n \u25cf Dura mater: a fibrous tissue enclosing the spinal cord and the cauda equina and as mentioned earlier it is continuous with the meningeal layer of the brain's dura mater as it ascends upward through the foramen magnus. At the inferior aspect, the spinal cord's dura ends at the second sacral vertebra (on the filum terminale). The dura also extends along the roots of the spinal nerves becoming continuous with the epineurium of those nerves. Since the dura lies loosely in the vertebral canal it is separated from the walls of the canal by the extradural dural space which contains the internal vertebral venous plexus.\n\n \u25cf Arachnoid mater: is a thin impermeable membrane situated between the dura mater above (lies in contact with the dura) and the pia mater below, however, it is separated from the pia mater by the subarachnoid space which is filled with CSF. At the superior aspect the arachnoid of the spinal cord is continuous with the arachnoid of the brain as it passes through the foramen magnum and at the inferior aspect it ends at the lower border of the second sacral vertebra.\n\n \u25cf Pia mater: a vascular membrane that lies in direct contact with the spinal cord. The pia mater shows the ligamentum denticulatum, a thickened membrane on both sides of the spinal cord that extends and passes laterally so the pia mater is adherent to the arachnoid and dura mater. The pia mater also extends to join the epineurium of each nerve root.\n\n\"",

      "\"description_seizure_pathologies\" : \"\n Seizures are a result of electrical disturbances within the neurons of the brain, direct causes are yet to be determined as the current etiology of seizures is described as multifactorial and not fully understood. However it has been shown that imbalances between the excititory neurotransmitters and inhibitory neurotransmitters causes a sequence of rapid neuronal firing either at a single area or the entire cerebral cortex resulting in a seizure.\n\n \u2713 Brain tumors and scar tissues can compress over the neurons and this applied pressure inevitably disrupts the balance between different neurotranmitter types leading to unequal firing of neurons while ischemia, hypoxia, electrolyte imbalances, and decreased glucose levels cause damage by disrupting the chemical components of the neurons as they are deprived from the essential elements keeping them viable, and upon neuronal weakness or death the firing is also disrupted thus unequal firing occurs leading to seizure occurrence.\n\n - Febrile seizures: occurs mostly in the pediatric population from the age of six months to six years upon contracting an infection, while the exact pathophysiology is yet to be determined, treatment is directed towards the underlying cause and diagnosis is made clinically and assisted with serology and culture.\n\n - Simple partial seizure: is a type of seizure that occurs at one area or lobe of the brain and represents with focal symptoms related to that particular area or lobe. The symptoms begin as a rising feeling in the gut, then flushing and dizziness set in which is followed by ictal (seizure associated) motor and non-motor symptoms that include muscle jerking and spasm along side visual or auditory hallucinations with incoherent speech. It is important to know that in a simple partial seizure (currently described as focal onset aware seizure) that the person affected is awake and aware of the seizure occurring. This condition is diagnosed clinically and assisted via electroenchephalogram and the current management regimen includes lamotrigine and carbamazipine.\n\n - Complex partial seizure: is a tpe of seizure that occurs at one area or lobe of the brain and presents with focal symptoms related to that area or lobe. The symptoms begin as a starring gaze with impaired awareness followed by lip-smacking and unresponsiveness. The main difference between this condition and simple partial seizure is the impaired consciousness associated with it. This condition is diagnosed clinically and assisted via electroencephalogram. The current management for this condition includes carabamazipine and phenobarbital.\n\n - Generalized seizures: are those that involve the entire brain and are of five types;\n \u25cf Atonic seizure: is a a type of generalized seizure that results in sudden loss or weakness in muscle tone where the individual affected collapses but is conscious throughout the bout and is aware of what is happening. First, a sense of weakness in the limbs is experienced and floppy neck develops, later the lower limbs give in and the person collapses, this condition is particularly dangerous in children as it makes them pron to head injury. It is diagnosed clinically and assisted via electroencephalogram and while it could be managed with lamotrigine and clonazepam, these medications only ameliorate and a special type of surgery called corpus callostomy is preserved for sever life-threatening cases.\n\n \u25cf Absence seizure: a type of generalized seizure where the affected individual would develop a starring gaze often looking upwards (mistaken for daydreaming) and remains unresponsive during the episode which lasts on average 10-15 seconds and the affected individual is not aware of experiencing such a bout. This condition is diagnosed clinically and assisted with electroencephalogram, the current management for this type of seizure is ethosuximide.\n\n \u25cf Myoclonic seizure: is a type of generalized seizure characterized by episodic/brief and aggressive muscle jerks particularly of the upper limbs as the person affected would experience sudden involuntary jerky movements. This condition is diagnosed clinically and is assisted with electroencephalogram, the current management for this type of seizure are levetiracetam and valproic acid.\n\n \u25cf Tonic seizure: is a type of simple partial seizure and can progress into becoming generalized seizure characterized by muscle stiffness which result in a tight sensation of the limbs and trunk as some patients show arching of the back and flexion of the limbs during tonic episodes. This condition is diagnosed clinically and assisted with electroencephalogram, the current management for this condition are topiramte, lamotrigine and valproic acid.\n\n \u25cf Clonic seizure: is a type of partial seizure that progresses into becoming a generalized seizure characterized by repeated and relatively long-lasting jerking of the muscles (unlike myoclonic seizure; brief and episodic). This condition is diagnosed clinically and assisted with electroencephalogram, the current management for this type of seizure is the same as tonic seizure.\n\n \u25cf Tonic-clonic seizure: is a generalized seizure combining both tonic and clonic types of seizure, the person affected would first experience aura prior to the episode which can be visual, auditory, or olfactory hallucinations, sparkling wide-spreading dots in their field of vision, and an upset stomach. Then, they would develop impaired consciousness and fall as their body takes in the shape of the alternating tonic and clonic seizures with stiffness and jerking of the muscles alongside lip smacking, biting of the tongue, backward eye-rolling, and occasionally urine or fecal incontinence. This condition is diagnosed clinically and assisted by electroencephalogram, the current management for this type of seizure is sodium valproate.\n\n\"",

      "\"description_vision_physiology\" : \"\n Vision is produced when light strikes the retina, the functional unit of vision perception. The retina is arranged into 9 layers with each layer possessing a distinctive function.\n\n - Layers of the retina and their function:\n \u25cf Pigmented layer of the retina: the melanin in this layer absorbs the light entering the eye and preventing the reflection of that light, if that light were to be reflected a low quality vision will be formed.\n\n \u25cf Rods of the retina: located in the periphery of the retina, they are photoreceptors that have a low sensitivity to light and enables the eye to form vision in dim/dark spaces, the rods play no role in the perception of colored visioned and have late adaptation to the dark (i.e when lights are off it takes a few seconds for vision to form by the rods) as well as low acuity since the vision formed by the rods are lacking in precision.\n\n \u25cf Cons of the retina: located in the center of the retina, they are photoreceptors that have a high light sensitivity and acuity, they are responsible for the perception of colored vision since they exist in the form of three color, red, blue, and green.\n\n \u25cf Outer nuclear layer of the retina: holds within it the cell bodies and nucleus of the rods and cones.\n\n \u25cf Outer plexiform layer of the retina: in this layer the rods and cones synapse with the horizontal cells that act as a center of integration and processing of the information carried by the rods and cones, they even modulate the information thus balancing the vision in dim and bright illumination.\n\n \u25cf Inner nuclear layer of the retina: this layer shows the synapses between the horizontal cells and the bipolar cells, it also shows the cell body and nucleus of the amacrine cells. The bipolar cells function in transmitting information from the horizontal cells to ganglion cells through direct synapses (direct pathway) or by synapsing with the amacrine cells first then the latter synapses with the ganglion cells (indirect pathway).\n\n \u25cf Inner plexiform layer of the retina: shows the synapses of bipolar cells and amacrine cells. The amacrine cells function in carrying information from the bipolar cells to the ganglion cells, they also have a higher efficacy in modulating information from the rods therefore are essential in dim/dark vision.\n\n \u25cf Ganglion cell layer of the retina: this layer shows synapses between the ganglion cells, the bipolar, and amacrine cells, the ganglion cells carry the information received from the above cells and send them via the ganglionic-retinal fibers to the optic nerve where the signal is then carried along the visual pathway to the visual cortex of the occipital lobe.\n\n \u25cf Inner limiting membrane of the retina: is the layer that form the boundary between the retina and the vitreous of the eye, it consists of astrocytes, glycosaminoglycans, and the foot process known as muller cells.\n\n \u2713 Once light strikes the retina a cascade of chemical reactions occur called the process of photo-reception, this process is responsible for the signal transduction through the layers of the retina.\n\n - Steps of photo-reception:\n 1: Once light hits the retina, it passes through a light-sensitive pigment called rhodopsin.\n\n 2: Within rhodopsin lies a molecule called 11-cis retinal which is converted upon light excitation to All-trans retinal through isomerization.\n\n 3: The conversion of 11-cis retinal to All-trans retinal causes the conversion of rhodopsin to metarhodopsin-2 whose function is to activate transducin.\n\n 4: Stimulation of transducin (G-protein coupled receptor), results in activation of the enzyme phosphodiesterase.\n\n 5: Phosphodiesterase breaks down cyclic-GMP to GMP (non-cyclic), and as a result cyclic-GMP is decreased.\n\n 6: Cyclic-GMP functions in keeping the sodium channels open allowing the influx of sodium into the cell, rendering the rods depolarization but since its has decreased, there is no sodium influx thus rods are hyperpolarized.\n\n 7: With hyperpolarization of the rods, they are able to acquire a better vision in the dark since their normal impulse, unlike other neurons, is hyperpolarization.\n\n - \u2713 In the cones this process differs in that 11-cis retinal is generated by the 11-cis retinol and that the cyclic GMP is not degraded, resulting in sodium influx and depolarization.\n\n - Macula lutea: is the pigmented part of the retina that lies at the center of the retina.\n\n - Fovea centralis: is the depression in the macula lutea that consists of a large number of cones, it is the part of the eye responsible for the highest visual acuity.\n\n - Receptive field: is the on/off and off/on system of the bipolar or ganglion cells where depending on the type of receptor stimulated, they would result in an on/ff or off/on action.\n \u25cf On-center bipolar cells: they posses the metabotropic receptor and so are inhibitory cells. When the photoreceptors are hyperpolarized by light at the center of they release less glutamate and so the on center bipolar cell is inhibited due to the metabotropic receptor it possesses thus rendering it depolarized (the decrease in glutamate activates the cell as per its receptor's obligation) and increasing its release of glutamate. In the dark, the photoreceptors are depolarized and will secrete more glutamate causing hyperpolarization of the on center bipolar cell (metabotropic receptor is an inhibitory receptor, that why with more glutamate the cell is inhibited) making it release less glutamate. This occurs when light is being shined on the center of the retina and the periphery is inhibited, hence the name on-center cell.\n\n \u25cf Off-center bipolar cells: it possesses the inotropic receptor therefore when the photoreceptors are hyper-polarized in the light making them release less glutamate the off center cells are hyperpolarized (due to the inotropic receptor; the lack of glutamate inhibits the cell) causing them to release less glutamate. When the photoreceptors are depolarized in the dark they release more glutamate thus depolarizing the off center bipolar cells (due to inotropic receptors; more glutamate activates the cell) causing it to release more glutamate. This occurs when light is being directed to the periphery of the retina and the center is inhibited, hence the name off-center cell.\n\n\"",

On the superior border of the medial surface of the hemisphere lies the paracentral lobule that surrounds the indentation produced by the central sulcus. The anterior part of the paracentral lobule is the continuation of the precentral gyrus on the medial surface and the posterior part is the continuation of the postcentral gyrus. The medial surface also shows the precuneus area whose are the posterior end of the cingulate sulcus anteriorly and the parieto-occipital sulcus posteriorly. The medial surface also shows a triangular area called the cuneus that is bounded by the parieto-occipital sulcus superiorlu, by the calcarine sulcus inferiorly and the superior medial margin posteriorly.\n\n - Inferior surface of the cerebral hemisphere (we are naming structures from medial to lateral): on the medial inferior surface first lies the calcarine sulcus, lateral to it is the lingual gyrus which lies between the calcarine and collateral sulcus, anterior to the lingual gyrus is the parahippocampal gyrus (forms the uncus on its anterior surface), lateral to the collateral sulcus is the medial occipito-temporal gyrus (and the rhinal sulci), lateral to the medial occipito-temporal gyrus is the occipito-temporal sulcus, lateral to the occipito-temporal sulcus is the occipito-temporal gyrus (the medial occipito-temporal and the occipito-temporal gyrus are two different gyri). On the inferior surface of the temporal lobe we see the olfactory bulb and the sulcus anterior to it is the olfactory sulcus and the gyrus medial to it is the gyrus rectus and lateral to it are for gyri called the orbital gyri. we can also see the optic nerve, optic chaisma, optic tract, mamillary body, and the occulomotor nerve.\n\n - Internal structures of the cerebral hemisphere: they are the lateral ventricles, the basal ganglia, the septum pellucidum, the tela choroidea, and the white matter of the cerebral hemisphere. all these structures will be discussed in later chapters.\n\n The diencephalon consists of the third ventricle and the structures forming its boundaries, extending anteriorly from the interventricular foramina to the point where the third ventricle becomes continuous with the cerebral aqueduct posteriorly. Subdivisions of the diencephalon include thalamus, subthalamus, epithalamus, hypothalamus (see their respective sections in Anatomy of the brain).\n\n - Surfaces of the diencephalon:\n \u25cf The superior surface: is hidden by the fornix (a bundle of fibers originating from the hippocampus of the temporal lobe and arching posteriorly above the thalamus in order to join with the mammillary body), however the superior wall of the diencephalon is formed by the roof of the third ventricle which is covered superiorly by the tela choroidea of the third ventricle (a vascular fold of pia mater).\n\n \u25cf The inferior surface: is formed of (anterior to posterior) optic chiasma, optic tract (on both sides, right and left), infundibulum, tuber cinereum and mammillary bodies.\n\n \u25cf The lateral surface: is bounded by the internal capsule of white matter and having nerve fibers that connect the cerebral cortex with other parts of the brainstem and spinal cord.\n\n \u25cf The medial surface: has a superior part which is formed by the medial surface of the thalamus and an inferior part which is formed by the hypothalamus with both the superior and inferior parts being separated from one another by the hypothalamic sulcus.\n\n\"",

The thyrohyoid ligament shows a circular opening at its posterolateral aspect, this opening provides entry for the pharyngeal branch of the vagus nerve and the pharyngeal arterial branch from the external carotid artery.\n\n \u25cf Hyoepiglottic ligament: is a sheet-like ligament originating from the posterior surface of the hyoid's body to the epiglottis.\n\n - Thyroid cartilage: lies below the hyoid bone and commonly referred to as \"adams apple\" from the cartilaginous prominence seen on its anterior body at the median plane. The thyroid cartilage continues posteriorly and at its posterior ends it forms two vertical processes, the long superior horn and the short superior horn. The long superior horn is connected to the posterior end of the hyoid bone by the dense lateral thyrohyoid ligament and the short inferior horn is inserted into the facet of the cricoid bone beneath. The thyroid cartilage is connected to the cricoid cartilage underneath from its posterior surface by the cricothyroid ligament (shows a dense ligament in the midline called the median cricothyroid ligament). On the posterolateral surface of the thyroid cartilage and just before the horns, a vertical bulge is seen which provides insertion for the inferior constrictor muscle of the pharynx.\n\n - Cricoid cartilage: is the only complete ring-like cartilage the encircles the trachea, anterior part takes shape of ring but its posterior part is a vertical sheet of cartilage that shows two depressions separated by a vertical ridge at the median plane. The cricoid has two facets, one is for the inferior horn of the thyroid cartilage located posterolaterally and the other is at the superior edge of the posterior part of the cricoid which is the facet of the arytenoid cartilage.\n\n - Arytenoid cartilage: a triangular shaped cartilage placed at right angles with the cricoid cartilage where the base of the triangle faces anteriorly and the three tips are connected to different structures, the lower tip is connected to the cricoid cartilage below and the upper tip is connected to the corniculate cartilage, the third tip pointing to the internal part of the trachea serves as attachment for the vocal ligament and is referred to as the vocal process. The lateral surface of the arytenoid cartilage shows two depression separated by a ridge in the middle, the upper depression serves as origin of the vestibular ligament and the lower depression serves as origin for the vocalis muscle.\n\n - Corniculate cartilage: a small piece of cartilage that is connected to the arytenoid cartilage below with its tip showing a slight bent 'almost hook-like'.\n\n - Cuneiform cartilage: a wedge-shaped structure located above, lateral and not connected to the corniculate cartilage.\n\n - Epiglottis: a sheet of cartilage often referred to as a flap due its ability of moving back and forth as part of its function in obstructing the esophagus during swallowing, it is connected to the thyroid cartilage anteriorly by the thryroepiglottic ligament at the thyroid prominence.

It is attached to the upper depression seen on the lateral surface of the arytenoid cartilage at one end and to the posterior surface of the thyroid cartilage at the other end. Not be confused with the vestibular fold which encloses the vestibular ligament (i.e the vestibular ligament lies within the vestibular fold), it is important to note that the vestibular fold lies above the vocal fold with a gap between both folds.\n\n - Blood supply of the larynx: two arteries supply the larynx, the superior laryngeal artery which is a branch of the superior thyroid artery that originates from the external carotid artery and the inferior laryngeal artery which is a branch of the thyrocervical trunk that originates from the subclavian artery.\n\n - Nerve supply of the larynx: the larynx is supplied by two principle branches of the vagus nerve, the superior and recurrent laryngeal nerves.\n \u25cf Superior laryngeal nerve: before entering the larynx it divides into an internal and an external branch. The internal branch enters the larynx by piercing through the lateral part of the thyrohyoid ligament and descends into branches that supply the mucosa of the laryngeal cavity (the internal branch is the sensory branch of the superior laryngeal nerve). The external branch enters the larynx at a lower level than the internal branch by piercing through the lateral part of the inferior pharyngeal constrictor muscle and descends to supply the cricothyroid muscle (the external branch is the motor branch of the superior laryngeal nerve).\n\n \u25cf Recurrent laryngeal nerve: gives off right and left branches, the right branch descends and loops around the right subclavian artery and ascends at the posterolateral side of the trachea and enter the larynx just below the inferior constrict pharyngeal muscle at the posterior surface of the cricoid cartilage. The left branch rises from the descending vagus nerve at the aortic arch where it the loops around the aortic arch and ascends back to the posterolateral side of the trachea and enter the larynx just below the inferior constrict pharyngeal muscle at the posterior surface of the cricoid cartilage. The recurrent laryngeal nerve provides motor innervation to the muscles of the larynx and sensory innervation to the laryngeal mucosa below the vocal folds.\n\n - Muscles of the larynx are identified as seven muscles:\n \u25cf Cricothyroid muscle: originates from the anterolateral part of the cricoid cartilage and terminates into the inferior margin of the thyroid cartilage, it functions in pulling and tensing the vocal ligament, and is the only muscle of the larynx that is innervated by the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve.\n\n \u25cf Thyroarytenoid muscle: is a sheet-like muscle originating from the posterior surface of the thyroid prominence and the lower cricothyroid ligament (lower i.e below the thyroid cartilage) to terminate into the medial ridge of the anterolateral surface of the arytenoid cartilage, it functions in relaxing the vocal ligament (counter-acting the cricothyroid ligament), receives innervation from the recurrent laryngeal nerve.\n\n \u25cf Vocalis muscle: originates from the vocal process of the arytenoid cartilage just lateral to the vocal ligament and terminates into the posterior surface of the thyroid cartilage just lateral to the termination of the vocal ligament (it is attaches along its path to the vocal ligament), it functions in tensing the proximal part of the vocal ligament and relaxing the distal part of the vocal ligament (and vice-versa), receives innervation from the recurrent laryngeal nerve.\n\n \u25cf Oblique arytenoid muscle: originates from the posterolateral base of the arytenoid cartilage and terminates to the upper posterolateral surface of the opposite arytenoid cartilage, it functions in adducting the arytenoid cartilages (moving them to the midline) closing the laryngeal inlet, receives its innervation from the recurrent laryngeal nerve.\n\n \u25cf Transverse arytenoid muscle: lies anterior to the oblique arytenoid muscle and originates from the lateral border of the arytenoid cartilage (from top to bottom) to terminate into the lateral border of the opposite arytenoid cartilage, it functions in adducting the arytenoid catilage and closing the laryngeal inlet, receives innervation from the recurrent laryngeal nerve.\n\n \u25cf Posterior cricoarytenoid muscle: originates from the lateral part of the posterior ridge of the cricoid cartilage to terminate in the proximal superior border of the cricoid cartilage, it functions in abducting the arytenoid cartilage and the vocal ligament (moving them away from the midline) opening the laryngeal inlet, it receives innervation from the recurrent laryngeal nerve.\n\n \u25cf lateral cricoarytenoid muscle: originates from the superior surface of the posterior proximal upper border of the cricoid cartilage to terminate into the muscular process of the arytenoid cartilage (the process conneted to the cricoid cartilage), it functions in adducting the vocal ligament by rotating the arytenoid cartilage medially thus closing the laryngeal inlet, it receives innervation from the recurrent laryngeal nerve.\n\n\"",

      "\"description_carbs_digestion\" : \"\n The process of carbohydrate digestion begins in the mouth where salivary alpha-amylase breaks down the carbohydrates (polysaccharides) into maltose by cleaving the alpha-1,4 glycosidic bond via hydrolyses, however salivary alpha-amylase does not cleave all carbohydrates and so the most digestion occurs in the samll intestine. The food bolus is swallowed into the stomach where the salivary amylase is inactivated by the stomach's low PH and so the food bolus is mechanically digested into smaller pieces rather than chemically modified.\n\n Once chyme passes into the small intestine, the pancreatic amylase in the duodenum breaks down the rest of the carbohydrates that salivary amylase wasn't able to break down.\n\n Pancreatic amylase only breaks down carbohydrates into disaccharides which are not capable of being absorbed by the intestinal villi therefore the enzymes present on the brush borders of the villi function into breaking down the disaccharide molecules into monosaccharides.\n\n - Lactase: functions in the breaking down of lactose by hydrolyzing the beta-1,4 glycosidic bonds resulting in galactose and glucose.\n\n - Maltase: funtions in the break down of maltose via hydrolysis by cleaving the alpha-1,4 glycosidic bonds resulting in two glucose molecules.\n\n - Isomaltase: an enzyme that cleaves polysaccharides at the alpha-1,6 glycosidic bond to produce alpha limit dextrin which is then cleaved by amylase to produce maltose that is eventually cleaved by maltase.\n\n - Sucrase: an enzyme that functions in the break down of sucrose via hydrolysis by cleaving the alpha-1,beta-2 glycosidic bonds resulting in fructose and glucose.\n\n\"",

      "\"description_gustatory_physiology\" : \"\n The gustatory sensation or taste is perceived by the taste buds on the tongue, these taste buds are located on the papillae of the tongue and since those papillae are of different types and located on different areas of the tongue, the taste buds they possess detect different tastes.\n\n - Papillae of the tongue:\n \u25cf Circumvallate papillae: are located at the base of the tongue and the taste buds in those function in perceiving bitter taste that is caused by alkaloids and long chain organic substances.\n\n \u25cf Foliate papillae: are located at the lateral edges of the tongue, postero-laterally and antero-laterally and taste buds in those function in detecting salt and sour taste respectively. The sourness of an edible matter depends on the hydrogen ions it accumulates with in it where the stronger the sour taste, the more hydrogen ions it accumulates. The saltiness of an edible depends on the sodium cations it accumulates with in, the more sodium cations, the more salty it tastes.\n\n \u25cf Fungiform papillae: are located at the anterior and tip surfaces of the tongue and the taste buds in those function in detecting sweet taste which is not attributed to a single class chemical element, rather it is produced by many organic chemicals.\n\n \u25cf Filiform papillae: they do not contribute to the sense of taste but give the surface of the tongue a rough and rigid surface for the grasp of food.\n\n \u2713 One distinct taste that is the taste of savouriness or umami which is detected by all papilla as it stimulates all the taste buds, the chemical that is able to carry on such a mechanism is monosodium glutamate which exceeds the threshold of all taste receptors thus is able to activate all of them.\n\n - Types of receptors in taste buds:\n \u25cf G-protein couples receptor: the tastes of sweet, bitter, and savour are detected by G-protein coupled receptors.\n\n \u25cf Ion channel receptors: salt and sour tastes are carried in by ion channels mainly sodium ion channels, resulting in direct depolarization.\n\n - Taste transduction:\n 1: The taste buds have pores projecting outward, and these pores are lines by microvilli that detect the molecules of taste.\n\n 2: The microvilli posses the taste receptors and depending on the receptor and taste molecule detected, the process of transduction occurs within the receptor.\n\n 3: The taste buds contain nerve fibers that carry depolarization to the major nerves supplying the tongue.\n\n 4: The chorda tympani nerve receives taste sensation from the anterior one third of the tongue, the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves receive taste sensation from the posterior and base of the tongue respectively.\n\n 5: The chorda tympani carries impulses to the geniculate ganglion of the facial nerve (first order neuron), the glossopharyngeal nerve carries impulses to the petrosal ganglion (first order neuron) of its own dorsal nerve ganglion, and the vagus nerve carries impulses to the nodose ganglion (first order neuron) of its own dorsal nerve ganglion.\n\n 6: Then these nerves carry the impulses from their respective first order neurons to the nucleus of tractus solitarius in the brainstem whih is the second order neuron.\n\n 7: The impulses travel from the nucleus of tractus solitarius to the ventral posterior medial nucleus of the thalamus (VPMN) which is the third motor neuron.\n\n 8: The impulses ascend from the third motor neuron and terminate in the post-centtral gyrus of the parietal lobe in the gustatory cortex and insula.\n\n\"",

      "\"description_loop_of_henle\" : \"\n The thin descending limb is the first tubule constituting the loop of henle and its main function is the further absorption of solutes and water from the filtrate.\n\n The thin descending limb is highly permeable to water as it is equipped with water channels along its lumen, these water channels called aquaporins and they permit the flow of water from the lumen to the basolateral space and into the peritubular capillaries, the solutes remaining are absorbed to a lesser extent that mainly sodium and chloride ions. Since more water is being absorbed than the ions the filtrate of the thin descending limb sustains a state of hyperosmolarity compared to plasma.\n\n The hyperosmolar filtrate then flows through the second part of the loop of henle, the thin ascending limb, this part is impermeable to water but contributes to the absorption of sodium and chloride ions. Although the absorption of solutes occurs at a lower rate and quantity compared to the other parts of the loop of henle, the filtrate looses a small fraction of its hyperosmolarity since there is a net absorption of solutes.\n\n The filtrate then passes through the third and last part of the loop of henle, the thick ascending limb, this part is majorly concerned with the absorption of solutes from the filtrate as the lumen is equipped with a special co-transporter, the Na-K-2Cl co-transporter.\n\n The Na-K-2Cl co-transporter is an electrochemically charged gate that transports four ions in total, sodium, potassium, and two chloride ions from the lumial filtrate and into the cell. The chloride and potassium ions passively diffuse into the basolateral space down their concentration gradient, the sodium ions are transported into the basolateral space in exchange of potassium via the sodium-potasssium ATPase pump located at the basolateral membrane, this pump also generates the electrochemical gradient utilized by the Na-K-2Cl co-transporter.\n\n \u2713 The loop of henle is a U-shaped structure and along the its internal borders runs another U-shaped structure known as the vasa recta which is a blood vessel that collects water and solutes as being the conduit of the counter current exchange.\n\n - counter-current exchange: as discussed earlier, more solutes and relatively small amounts of water move out of the thick ascending limb and the thin descending limb respectively. These substances then reside and accumulate in the renal interstitium and as a result of high amounts of solutes compared to water, the renal interstitium increase in osmolarity, this requires the solutes to be washed out from the interstitium through the vasa recta. The blood within the vasa recta first passes by the thick ascending limb where it flows to the latter's counter-current (fluid moves up the thick ascending limb while blood in the vasa recta moves down the ascending limb) passing by the thin ascending and thick descending limbs thus washing out the solutes as the blood picks up the solutes into the peri-tubular circulation and water from the renal interstitium along its way.\n\n \u2713 One important aspect in the counter-current exchange is the role of Anti-diuretic hormone (ADH). When present, ADH up-regulates the luminal Na-K-2Cl co-transporter where such action results in more solutes being absorbed and the osmolarity of the interstitial fluid increases, then the solutes are carried away via the vasa recta as it passes by all parts of the loop of henle and carrying the water in the interstitium along the way.\n\n\"",

      "\"description_infectious_resp_patho\" : \"\n - Pneumonia: is infection and inflammation of the lung's parenchyma caused by viruses, bacteria, or fungi. Pneumonia can be community or hospital acquired with hallmark micro-organisms representing each type. Pneumonia can also be categorized with the extent of parenchymal involvement, lobar pneumonia is when consolidation is seen in an entire lobe or a part of the lobe, broncho-pulmonary pneumonia is when infiltrates take on a broncho-pulmonary pattern, and interstitial pneumonia is when infiltrates cover the entire lung. It presents with fever, chills, dyspnea, chest tightness and pain, fatigue, productive cough (dependent on micro-organism present), hemoptysis (extensive or TB pneumonia), generalized fatigue, and headache.\n\n \u2713 Often when individuals are diagnosed with pneumonia clinically and via chest X-ray are prescribed azithromycin or levofloxacin as empirical treatment since they cover most community aqcuired pneumonia until cultures are out. But spirometry, sputum culture and blood culture are essential in the diagnostic process of pneumonia.\n\n - Causitive agents of community aqcuired pneumonia:\n \u25cf Influenza A and B: are seasonal viruses that cause pneumonia with mild chest X-ray markings but management of this virus is conservative therapy but the most feared complication is superimposed bacterial infections mostly staphylococcus aureus.\n\n \u25cf Staphylococcus aureus: mostly occurs as a superimposed infection to viral pneumonia or by skin penetration. It causes lobar and broncho-pneumonia, it is managed with vancomycin and linezolid.\n\n \u25cf Streptococcus pneumonea: transmitted via droplet inhalation resulting in lobar pneumonia with blood streaked sputum, this micro-organism is treated with amoxicillin.\n\n \u25cf Heamophilus influenzae: occurs via droplet transmission, it results in broncho pneumonia and is diagnosed by blood culture. Heamophilus influenzae is an invasive micro-organism capable of causing mutli-system infections such as sepsis, meningitis, and osteomyelitis. This micro-organism is treated with ceftriaxone.\n\n \u25cf Legionella pneumophila: occurs via droplet transmission, it results in broncho pneumonia and is diagnosed by blood culture and urine antigen test when it presents in the form of pontaic fever or the more sever legionnaire's disease. It is treated with levofloxacin.\n\n \u25cf Moraxella catarrhalis: occurs via droplet transmission, it results in broncho pneumonia and mainly affects the immunocompromised and those with pre-existing respiratory pathologies such as COPD. It is managed with amoxicillin-calvulanate.\n\n \u25cf Streptococcus pyogenes: a group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus micro-organism transmitted via droplets results in broncho-pneumonia. It is a serious infection due to the post-infectious sequelae of rheumatic heart disease and post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. It is treated with amoxicillin.\n\n \u25cf Mycoplasma pneumonea: transmitted via droplets, it results in interstitial pneumonia. This micro-organism cannot be stained since it lacks a cell wall therefore it is diagnosed by PCR. This micro-organism is treated with azithromycin.\n\n \u25cf Mycobacterium tuberculosis: transmitted via droplets resulting in interstitial pneumonia, this micro-organism is identified by a ziehl-neelsen stain and diagnosed by tuberculin skin test and interferon-gamma release assay. The hallmark presentation is fever, hemoptysis, weight loss, chills, and night sweats. It is treated with rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol.\n\n - Causitive agents of Hospital acquired pneumonia:\n \u25cf Escherichia coli: transmitted via direct contact of infected surface or person, it results in broncho-pneumonia. It is diagnosed by blood and sputum culture, it is treated with piperacillin-tazobactam. Usage of this antibiotic is essential in nosocomial strains of E.coli given the resistance they pose to other antibiotics.\n\n \u25cf Klebsiella pneumoniae: transmitted via direct contact, it results in lobar pneumonia. It is diagnosed by sputum and blood culture, treated with meropenem and imipenem.\n\n \u25cf Pseudomonas aeruoginosa: is transmitted via direct contact and ingestion of contaminated water resulting in broncho-pneumonia. It is diagnosed with sputum and blood culture, treated with gentamicin, meropenem, and moxifloxacin.\n\n\"",

As it lies on the anterior thoracic wall, the breast also lies anterior to the pectoral muscle and is separated from the latter by the retromammary space. The breast also shows an axillary tail, which is part of the breast tissue that extends backwards to the axillary fossa. The exterior surface of the breast shows a dark pigmented circular region called the areola and the center of the areola shows a fleshy projection which is the nipple (during pregnancy the areola darkens and the nipple gets bigger than its normal size).\n\n The breast consists of fat tissue, connective tissue also called stroma, lactiferous ducts and suspensory ligaments.\n \u25cf The fat tissue and stroma give the breast its shape and provide support to the structure.\n\n \u25cf The acini are the functioning unit of the breast, they are glands that produce milk upon progesterone stimulation (see reproductive physiology - female androgens section). The acini open into the terminal ducts, the terminal ducts open into the interlobular ducts, the interlubular ducts continues to become the excretory ducts, then the excretory ducts become the lectiferous ducts hich open into the nipple. The lectiferous ducts are lined by columnar epithelium at first and by stratified squamous epithelium as they open into the nipple.\n\n \u25cf The suspensory ligaments originate from the fascia of the pectoral muscle and terminate into the dermis of the breast tissue, they function in preventing the breast from sagging but they are weakened as the person get older.\n\n - Blood supply of the breast: the breast is supplied by the internal thoracic artery (branch of the subclavian artery; supplies the anteromedial part of the breast), lateral thoracic artery (branch of the axillary artery; supplies the anterolateral part of the breast), thoraco-acromial artery (branch of the axillary artery; supplies the anterolateral part of the breast), the second to fourth anterior intercostal arteries (supply the upper part of the breast), the fifth and sixth anterior intercostal arteries (supply the inferior part of the breast).\n\n - Nerve supply of the breast: it receives sensory innervation from the anterior and lateral cutaneous branches of the second to sixth intercostal nerves while the areola receives innervation from the anterior and lateral cutaneous branches of the fourth intercostal nerve.\n\n\"",

      "\"description_acid_base_renal_patho\" : \"\n Acidosis and alkalosis comprise the two extremes of the acid-base balance of our body. Acidosis is the decrease in blood PH below 7.35 while alkalosis is the rise of blood PH above 7.45, these readings are obtained by arterial blood gas. Other important feature provided by the arterial blood gas is the anion gap (normal range 5-15mmol/L) which is a guide used to tell the cause of the acidosis or alkalosis present. Electrolytes and bicarbonate levels are also readings provided by the arterial blood gas.\n\n \u2713 Acidosis and alkalosis can both be either metabolic or respiratory in origin. Always notice the PH, Anion gap, Pco2 (normal range 36-44mmhg), Hco3 (normal range 22-30mmhg), and potassium.\n\n - Metabolic acidosis: is a fall in blood PH below 7.35 and may be associated with a deranged anion gap. In this condition, the arterial blood gas would show a low PH, low Pco2, and low Hco3.\n\n \u25cf Normal anion gap metabolic acidosis: is a result of bicarbonate excretion from the body either through diarrhea and prolonged use of acetazolamide which inhibits Hco3 formation resulting in renal tubular acidosis (a condition also seen in multiple myeloma). It presents with a normal anion gap and acidosis features with characteristic kussmal breathing (deep-breath hyperventilation). Management of this condition includes treatment directed towards the underlying cause and sodium bicarbonate IV.\n\n \u25cf Elevated anion gap metabolic acidosis: is a result of increases lactic acid and/or ketones in the blood which occurs in systemic shock, diabetic ketoacidosis, renal failure, and aspirin overdose. It presents with high anion gap, Hyperkalemia, and ABG values similar to normal anion gap acidosis. Management of this condition includes normal saline IV, sodium bicarbonate IV, Insulin (for diabetic ketoacidosis; also used for Hyperkalemia), and dextrose IV (used in diabetic ketoacidosis).\n\n - Respiratory acidosis: is a fall in PH less than 7.35 and a rise in PaCo2 (arterial Co2) due to an underlying respiratory condition (bronchiectasis, emphysema, and COPD) or respiratory depression (opioids) that causes hypoventilation where Co2 is not adequately excreted by the lungs. It presents with flap tremors, confusion, and headaches. Management of this condition includes treatment directed towards the underlying cause, ipratropium bromide, sulbutamol, oxygen administration (close monitoring; may worsen emphysema), and intubation (opioid-induced respiratory depression).\n\n - Metabolic alkalosis: is a rise in PH level above 7.45 and a rise in bicarbonate above 30mmhg alongside a rise in Pco2 due to recurrent vomiting, metabolic alkalosis is classically seen in pyloric stenosis which causes hypochloremic hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis. Management of this condition includes treatment directed towards the underlying cause and normal saline IV with potassium and chloride.\n\n - Respiratory alkalosis: is a rise in PH above 7.45 and a fall in Pco2 and bicarbonate, this condition occurs almost always as a result of an underlying pathology that results in hyperventilation such as chronic anemia, pneumonia, and pulmonary edema. Management of this condition includes treatment directed towards the underlying cause.\n\n\"",

It is classified as low volume (water; extracellular fluid) hypernatremia, normal volume hypernatremia, and high volume hypernatremia. Regardless of the type, hypernatremia presents with restlessness, fatigue, confusion, and seizure. This condition is diagnosed by serum sodium levels, urine sodium levels, urine osmolality levels.\n\n \u25cf Low volume hypernatremia: occurs when there is more loss of water in relation to sodium, this occurs in excessive watery diarrhea and for individuals on furosemide/thiazide diuretics. Management of this condition includes IV normal saline.\n\n \u25cf Normal volume hypernatremia: occurs when there is no loss of water but sodium concentration rises, this occurs in individuals with diabetes insipidus where there is excess urination without solute concentration due to the lack of anti-diuretic hormone (see endocrine pathology; pathology of the posterior pituitary gland section). Management of this condition includes treatment directed towards the underlying cause.\n\n \u25cf High volume hypernatremia: occurs when there is excess water and sodium retention, this mostly occurs in individuals with adrenal gland disorders such as cushing's syndrome and hyper-aldosteronism (see endocrine pathology - pathologies of the supra-renal gland) or in those receiving fluid replacement therapy with sodium bicarbonate. Management of this condition includes treatment directed towards the underlying cause.\n\n - Hyponatremia: is a condition characterized by sodium serum levels below 135mmol/L resulting almost always from an underlying pathology. The serum osmolality is the guide towards diagnosis and management as one less than 280mosm/kg (true Hyponatremia) requires further testing (guided by urine sodium level) while those above are due to high blood glucose or dyslipidemia. This condition presents with diarrhea, vomiting, hypertension, irritability, fatigue, and exaggerated deep tendon reflexes.\n\n \u25cf Low volume hyponatremia: occurs when there is loss of water and sodium, this occurs with individuals on furosemide/thiazide diuretics and those with vomiting and diarrhea (note that hypernatremia is due to diarrhea only while Hyponatermia is due to vomiting and diarrhea). Management of this condition includes IV normal saline.\n\n \u25cf Normal volume hyponatremia: occurs when sodium levels are decreased in the blood but water levels remain the same, this occurs in individuals with syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone where ADH levels increase, water is retained, and salt in urine is concentrated. Management of this condition includes tolvaptan. \n\n \u25cf High volume hyponatremia: occurs when water volume is high and sodium levels are low, this occur in underlying conditions that herald volume overload such as liver pathologies (ascites), renal injury (fluid retention), and cardiac pathologies (volume overload). Management of this condition includes fluid restriction. \n\n - Hypercalcemia: is when serum calcium levels are above 10.3mg/dL, this condition occurs almost always as a result of an underlying pathology. Causes of hypercalcemia include hyper-parathyroidism, multiple myeloma, vitamin-D toxicity, and neoplastic syndromes (small cell lung cancer). This condition presents with abdominal pain, myalgia, constipation, kidney stones, and low mood. This condition is diagnosed by lab testing for Electrolyte profile, PTH, amylase and lipase, M-spike in blood and urine (see pathologies of the blood - white blood cell pathology), BUN, and creatinine. Management of this condition includes IV normal saline, biphosphonate, and calcitonin.\n\n - Hypocalcemia: is when serum calcium levels are below 8.5 mg/dL, this condition occurs almost always as a result of an underlying pathology. Causes of hypocalcemia include hypo-parathyroidism, metabolic alkalosis, and acute pancreatitis. This condition presents with tingling of the Peripheral limbs, prolonged QT-interval on ecg, characteristic chvostek and trousseau sign, and exaggerated deep tendon reflexes. This condition is diagnosed by the similar blood tests conducted for hypercalcemia except for M-spike protein. Management of this condition includes calcium gluconate IV.\n\n - Hyperphosphatemia: is when serum phosphate levels are above 4.7mg/dL, this condition occurs almost always as a result of an underlying pathology. Causes of hyper-phosphatemia include metabolic acidosis, renal injury, and hypo-parathyroidism. Since hypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia occur spontaneously together, it presents with hypocalcemia symptoms in addition to tissue calcification. This condition is diagnosed by lab tests for serum and urine phosphate. Management of this condition includes phosphate administration and cholecalciferol.\n\n - Hyperkalemia: is when potassium serum levels are above 5.3mmol/L, this condition occurs almost always as a result of an underlying pathology. Causes of hyperkalemia include diabetic ketoacidosis, low insulin levels, renal injury(CKD individuals skipping dialysis), Addison disease, and prolonged use of spironolactone (potassium-sparring diuretic). This condition presents with fatigue, GI upset and diarrhea, symptoms of DKA, and the most profound effect of arrhythmia preceded by characteristic peaked T-wave on ECG. This condition is diagnosed by the described ECG change and serum plasma levels. Management of this condition includes calcium gluconate IV and insulin.\n\n - Hypokalemia: is when serum potassium is less than 3.5mmol/L, this condition occurs almost always as a result of an underlying pathology. Causes of Hypokalemia include chronic use of non-potassium sparring diuretics, profuse diarrhea and vomiting, chronic insulin use in diabetics. This condition presents with fatigue, nausea and vomiting, muscle spasms, diminished deep tendon reflexes, and the most profound effect of arrhythmia preceded by a flat T-wave that is accompanied by a U-wave (a small elevation just after the T-wave) on ECG. This condition is diagnosed by the described ECG change amd serum plasma levels. Management of this condition includes potassiim chloride IV.\n\n - Hypermagnesemia: is when serum magnesium levels are above 2.5mg/dL, this condition occurs almost always as a result of an underlying pathology. Causes of Hypermagnesemia are similar to those of hyperkalemia but additionally include supra-renal dysfunction, end-stage renal failure, and muscle trauma. It presents with progressive fatigue and myalgia, peri-oral tingling, diminished deep tendon reflexes, and ECG changes similar to those of hypokalemia. This condition is diagnosed by the described ECG changes and serum plasma levels. Management of this condition includes calcium gluconate.\n\n - Hypomagnesemia: is when serum magnesium levels are below 1.8 mg/dL, this condition occurs almost always as a result of an underlying pathology. Causes of hypomagnesemia include second and third degree burns, chronic alcohol consumption, SIADH, and diabetic ketoacidosis. It presents with Irritability, fatigue, muscle spasms, exaggerated deep tendon reflexes, and the most profound effect of torsade de pointes preceded by progressive prolongation of QT-interval on ECG.

However, both hemispheres are connected deep down by a mass of white matter known as corpus callosum.\n\n Surface of the cerebral hemisphere: is made up of gray matter and show numerous folds called gyri (singular; gyrus) that are separated from one another by fissures or sulci (there are main sulci that helps in defining the lobes of the cerebral hemispheres and are named after the cranial bones they lie under).\n\n Inner part of the cerebral hemisphere: is composed of white matter containing large masses of gray matter called the basal nuclei and a collection of nerve fibers called corona radiata that span the entire cerebral hemisphere and travels in the white matter from the cerebral cortex to the brain stem and vice versa. The corona radiata converges on the basal nuclei and passes between them as the internal capsule (an important site where nerve tracts pass through).\n\n The midbrain: is the connecting point between the forebrain and hindbrain, it contains many nuclei and bundles of ascending and descending nerve fibers that will be discussed in the sections ascending tracts of the spinal cord and descending tracts of the spinal cord.\n\n - The hindbrain: consists of the medulla oblongata, pons and the cerebellum.\n \u25cf The medulla oblongata connects the pons to the spinal cord serving as a conduit for ascending and descending nerve fibers.\n \u25cf The pons: located anterior to the cerebellum, below the midbrain and above the medulla oblongata, connects the two cerebellar hemispheres and serves as a conduit for the ascending and descending spinal tracts.\n \u25cf The cerebellum: lies in the posterior cranial fossa of the skull posterior to the pons and the medulla oblongata. It consists of two hemispheres connected at the midline by the vermis.\n\n The surface of the cerebellum is composed of gray matter and is thrown into folds separated from one another by transverse fissures and its interior is composed of white matter with several interspersed masses of gray matter. The cerebellum is connected to the midbrain by the superior cerebellar peduncle and to the pons by the middle cerebellar peduncle and to the medulla oblongata by the inferior cerebellar peduncle.\n\n The spinal cord is shorter than the vertebral column thus the segments of the spinal cord do not correspond numerically with the vertebrae that lies at the same level. the vertebral column is divided into thirty three segments with seven cervical vertebrae, twelve thoracic vertebrae, five lumbar vertebrae, five sacral vertebrae and one coccygeal vertebra but the spinal cord is divided into thirty one segments with eight cervical segments, twelve thoracic segments, five lumbar segments, five sacral segments and one coccygeal segment.\n\n In the cervical region the spinal nerves exiting the vertebral column through the intervertebral formaina above its associated vertebra ( spinal nerve C1 exits above cervical vertebra 1 and spinal nerve C1 exits above cervical vertebra 2 and so on) with the exception of the spinal nerve C8 that exits below the seventh cervical vertebra and from the first thoracic vertebra spinal nerves exit below their associated vertebra (spinal nerve T1 exit below T1 vertebra and so on).\n\n From the thoracic region downward the spinal nerves start to go from horizontal to oblique and then they become vertical due to their descent and ending of the spinal cord at the lumbar segment (L5 vertebra) eventually forming the quada equina (spinal nerves floating in the cerebrospinal fluid).\n\n When viewing the first lumbar vertebra you are actually viewing the level of the sacral and coccygeal spinal segments, when viewing the twelfth thoracic vertebra you are actually viewing the L5 spinal segment, when you are viewing the 11th thoracic vertebra you are actually at the L3-L4 spinal segment, when viewing the 10th thoracic vertebra you are actually viewing the L1-L2 spinal segment.\n\n At the lower thoracic vertebra (T7-T9) we add three, so when viewing vertebra T7 we are actually viewing spinal segment T10.\n\n At the upper thoracic vertebrae we add two, so when viewing T3 vertebra we are actually viewing T5 spinal segment.\n\n At the cervical vertebra we add one as when viewing C3 vertebra we are actually viewing C4 spinal segment.\n\n Microglia are cells that support the neurons, they vastly outnumber the neurons and are much smaller.\n\n The glial cells are: astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia and ependyma.\n\n - Astrocytes: are of two types; fibrous and protoplasmic astrocytes.\n \u25cf Fibrous astrocytes: are found in the white matter, they consist of small cell bodies with long thin processes, cytoplasmic filaments and perivascular feet (their processes expand to end in expansion on blood vessels). their function is to provide a supporting framework for the neurons, they act as electrical insulators preventing the axon terminals from influencing neighboring and unrelated neurons, limit the spread of neurotransmitters by acting as a barrier to those released at synapses, take up excess potassium ions that have build up in the extracellular space.\n\n \u25cf Protoplasmic astrocytes: are found in the gray matter, they consist of small cell bodies with short thick processes, few cytoplasmic filaments, perivascular feet and are heavily branched. they function in storing glycogen within their cytoplasm (glycogen can be broken down into glucose and further into lactate which both can be released to surrounding neurons by norepinephrine), they possess a phagocytic function by taking up degenerating synaptic axon terminals, they fill in the space of previously dead neurons by proliferating to their space (a process called replacement gliosis), serve as a conduit for materials to pass from blood capillaries to neurons through their perivascular feet, produce trophic substances that influence neighboring neurons.\n\n - Oligo-dendrocytes: are located in the brain and spinal cord, they are the equivalent of schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system, their function is to produce the myelin sheath for neurons in the brain and spinal cord. The myelin act as an insulator fro the axons and provides high speed transmission along the length of the axon. they consist of small cell bodies, few delicate processes and have no filaments in their cytoplasm.\n\n - Microglial cells: are the smallest neuroglial cells, they consists of small cell bodies from which arise numerous wavy branching processes that give off numerous spike-like projections. They are inactive in the normal CNS tissue but during an inflammatory disease they become active and migrate to the site of assault by retracting their processes. At the site of assault they proliferate and become antigen presenting cells.\n\n - Ependymal cells: consists of three types and they are ependymocytes, tanycytes and choroidal epithelial cells.\n\n \u25cf Ependymocytes are cuboidal in shape and are lined by cilia amd microvilli they also posses gap junctions, they line the ventricles of the brain and the central canal of the spinal cord, their function is related to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as they both circulate and absorb the CSF.\n\n \u25cf Tanycytes consist of long basal processes having end feet on capillaries, they line the floor of the third ventricle, since the floor third ventricle overlies the median eminence of the hypothalamus tanycytes transport substances from the CSF to the hypophyseal-portal system (see endocrine physiology - hypothalamus-pituitary axis section).\n\n \u25cf Choroidal epithelial cells, they cover the surfaces of the choroid plexuses, their sides and bases are thrown into folds and they show tight junctions that hold the cells together and prevent leakage of CSF into underlying tissue, choroidal epithelial cells function in secretion and production of CSF.\n\n Nerve fibers could be myelinated and non myelinated (either covered with myelin or not), as mentioned earlier oligodendrocytes produce myelin in the CNS and schwann cells produce myelin in the PNS. now, although the myelin sheath covers the entire path of the axon its is not continuous, as we move along a myelinated axon we can see junctions where the myelin is interrupted at regular intervals these junctions are called nodes of Ranvier.\n\n Peripheral nerves are classified according to their size and speed in conducting impulses, they are of four types; fibers A (subdivided to alpha, beta, gamma, delta), fibers B and fibers C (both B and C fibers have no subtypes).\n\n - Type A alpha nerve fibers (myelinated; largest in diameter and fastest in impulse conduction) they are concerned with motor function of skeletal muscle.\n\n \u25cf Type A beta nerve fibers: have a sensory function concerned with touch, pressure and vibration.\n\n \u25cf Type A gamma nerve fibers are concerned with muscle spindles (see skeletal muscle physiology section).\n\n \u25cf Type A delta nerve fibers (myelinated), function in sensing sharp and localized pain also touch and temperature.\n\n - Type B nerve fibers (myelinated): are concerned with functions of pre-ganglionic autonomic mechanisms.\n\n - Type C nerve fibers (non-myelinated): has the smallest diameter and the lowest speed in impulse conduction, they function in sensing diffuse and deep pain, temperature, and post-ganglionic autonomic mechanisms.\n\n \u2713 The spinal cord, consists of an inner core of gray matter and an outer surrounding of white matter.\n\n - Levels of the spinal cord:\n - Cervical segment of the spinal cord: is oval in shape with a white matter consisting of fasiculus gracilis and fasiculus cuneatus as for its gray matter (has no lateral gray column) its anterior gray column has medial group of cells for neck muscles, central group of cells for accessory nucleus and phrenic nucleus, lateral group of cells for muscles of the upper limb. its posterior gray column has substansia gelatinosa, nucleus porpius with no nucleus dorsalis.\n\n \u25cf Thoracic segment of the spinal cord: is round in shape and its white matter shows fasciculus gracilis and fasciculus cuneatus as for its gray matter the anterior white column has medial group of cells for the trunk muscles, the posterior gray column shows substantia gelatinos, nucleus propius, nucleus dorsalis and visceral afferent nucleus, the lateral gray column gives rise to preganglionic sympathetic fibers.\n\n \u25cf Lumbar segement of the spinal cord: is round to oval in shape and its white matter consists of fasciculus gracilis with no fasciculus cuneatus as for its gray matter the anterior gray column has medial group of cells for lower limb muscles and central group of cells for lumbosacral nerve, the posterior gray horn contains substantia gelatinosa, nuclues propius, nucleus dorsalis and visceral afferent nucleus, the lateral gray horn gives rise to preganglionic sympathetic fibers.\n\n \u25cf Sacral segement of the spinal cord: is round and its white matter is present at minimal amounts but contains fasciculus gracilis, as for its gray matter the anterior white column has medial group of cells for lower limb and perineal muscles, the posterior gray column has substantia gelatinosa and nucleus propius, its lateral gray horn is absent but group of cells are present at S2-S4 for parasympathetic outflow.\n\n - Cell groups of the spinal cord:\n \u25cf Anterior gray column: medial cells group innervates skeletal muscles of the neck and trunk (intercostal and abdominal muscles), central cell group of segments C3-C5 innervate the diaphragm and segments C1-C5 innervate the sternocliedomastoid and trapezius muscles (central cells of segments C1-C5 are called accessory nucleus), lateral cell group in the cerical and lumbosacral segments of the spinal cord innervate the muscles of the limbs.\n\n \u25cf Posterior gray column: the first nucleus is substantia gelatinosa located at the apex of the posterior gray column (present along the entire length of the spinal cord) receiving pain, touch and temperature sensations from the posterior root of the spinal cord. nucleus propius which lies anterior to substantia gelatinosa (present along the length of the spinal cord) receives sensory fibers from the posterior white column that are responsible for senses of proprioception (position and movement), two-point discrimination, and vibration. Nuclues dorsalis located at the base of the posterior gray column (extends from C8-L3) receives proprioceptive sensory input from neuromuscular and tendon spindles. Visceral afferent nucleus (extends from T1-L3) lies lateral to the nucleus dorsalis, it receives visceral afferent information.\n\n \u25cf Lateral gray column cell groups (extending from T1-L3) give rise to preganglionic sympathetic fibers and group of cells similar those extend from S2-S4 that give rise to preganglionc parasympathetic fibers.\n\n The white matter of the spinal cord is described as anterior, posterior, and lateral columns.\n\n\"",

      "\"description_female_genitalia_anatomy\" : \"\n The female genitalia consists of primary reproductive organs, the vagina, cervix, uterus, uterine tube, and the ovaries. The primary reproductive organs are anchored in their designated positions by supporting structures.\n\n - Vagina: as it opens to the exterior of the body, the vagina is located in the urogenital triangle of the perineum and extends upward to the cervix. On the exterior the opening of the vagina is covered by an elastic mucous membrane called the hymen and beyond the opening lies the labia minora, a soft flappy tissue that extends from the bottom of the clitoris to the lower end of the vaginal opening (above the vaginal opening is the external urethral orifice). Lateral to the labia minora is the labia majora and extends from above the clitoris to the lower part of the labia minora. The interior of the vagina is lined by stratified squamous mucousa and shows mucousal folds or vaginal rugae.\n\n - Support of the vagina:\n \u25cf Levator ani muscles: they support the upper portion of the vagina.\n\n \u25cf Pubo-cervical ligamnet: arises from the dorsal surface of the pubic bone and runs inward to attach to the antero-lateral surface of the cervix, it stabilizes the upper portion of the vagina and lower potion of the cervix.\n\n \u25cf Sacro-cervical ligament: arises from the dorsal surface of the sacrum and runs inward to attach to the postero-lateral side of the cervix, it stabilizes the upper portion of the vagina and lower part of the cervix.\n\n \u25cf Trans-cervical ligament: arises from the lateral wall of the pelvis and run inward to attach to the lateral side of the cervix, it stabilizes the upper portion of the vagina and the lower portion of the cervix.\n\n \u25cf Pelvic floor: supports the lower portion of the vagina.\n\n - Clitoris: a fleshy rubbery structure that lies in the most superior part of the vulva. It is formed by a pair of the crus of clitoris that lies in the lateral part of the superficial perineal membrane and those two crura meet at the midline (below pubic symphysis) to form the corpora cavernosa (root of the clitoris). The clitoris is also formed by the bulb of vestibule which also lies in the superficial perineal membrane just lateral to the vaginal opening, the fibers of the bulb of vestibule converge to the midline above the external urethral orifice to give off a free body called the glans clitoris (which is attached by erectile tissue to the root of the clitoris). The crura of clitoris is covered by the ischiocavernosus muscle and the bulb of vestibule is covered by the bulbospongiosus muscle.\n\n - Cervix: is a narrow tube-like space (3-4 cm in length) line with columnar cells connecting the vagina to the uterus with an external orifice (external os) opening into the vagina and an internal orifice (internal os) opening into the uterus. The external cervical orifice shows two muscular projections on its anterior and posterior sides called the anterior and posterior forceps and related to these forceps is gutter-like space on each side that lies between the forceps and the wall of the vagina (both posterior and anterior vaginal walls) called the anterior and posterior fornices. The forceps are soft and rubbery in texture they are described to be having a texture that resembles the nose, however its texture may differ among the different female hormonal cycle changes. The part of the cervix related to the vagina, otherwise known as the ecto-cervix is lined with stratified non-keratinized squamous epithelium. The cervix lies in a diagonal angle that is seen to be pointing postero-medially in relation to the cervix.\n\n - Uterus: lies between the bladder and the rectum, is a muscular hollow organ that is divided into two parts and consists of three layers.\n\n \u25cf Fundus: is the most superior dome-shaped structure of the uterus and this internal part of the uterus related to the fundus receives the uterine tubes.\n\n \u25cf Body: the body of the uterus extends from below the opening of the uterine tube to the level of the cervical internal orifice (internal os) and the internal space (lumen) of the body of uterus is triangular in shape as the body is seen to be descending infero-medially. The body of the uterus is normally anteverted (lying at a 140 degree angle in relation to the vagina) and anteflexed (lying at a 140 degree angle in relation to the cervix) and due to this anteflexion the uterus is seen to be bending over the urinary bladder.\n\n - Layers of the uterus:\n \u25cf endometrium: is the inner lining of the uterus that degenerates and regenerates during the female hormonal cycle.\n\n \u25cf Myometrium: is the bulky musular layer of the uterus that function in holding the fetus and is increased and decreased in size according to the female hormonal cycle.\n\n Perimetrium: is the external part of the uterus, it is covered by the peritoneum or serosa thus making the uterus an intra-pritoneal organ.\n\n - Structures supporting the uterus:\n \u25cf Perineal body: see anatomy of the pelvis - fascia of the perineum.\n\n \u25cf Pelvic diaphragm: see anatomy of the pelvis - muscles of the perineum.\n\n \u25cf Pubo-cervical ligament: arises from the dorsal surface of the pubic bone and runs inward to attach to the antero-lateral surface of the cervix, it stabilizes the upper portion of the vagina and lower potion of the cervix. By holding the latter in place this ligament prevents unwanted movements of the uterus.\n\n \u25cf Trans-cervical ligament: arises from the lateral wall of the pelvis and run inward to attach to the lateral side of the cervix, it stabilizes the upper portion of the vagina and the lower portion of the cervix. By holding the latter in place this ligament prevents unwanted movements of the uterus.\n\n \u25cf Sacro-cervical ligament: arises from the dorsal surface of the sacrum and runs inward to attach to the postero-lateral side of the cervix, it stabilizes the upper portion of the vagina and lower part of the cervix. By holding the latter in place this, ligament prevents unwanted movements of the uterus.\n\n \u25cf Broad ligament: is a peritoneal ligament formed by a double layer of peritoneum and extends from above the uterine tube as a free border and descends to join the peritoneum of the pelvis that covers the urinary bladder. It is called the broad ligament for its length and width as it extends from the lateral surface of the uterus to the lateral wall of the pelvis. The meso-salpinx is a peritoneal fold of the broad ligament that covers the uterine tubes while the meso-varium is a double layer of peritoneal fold of the broad ligament that attaches to the posterior surface of the ovary and connects it to the posterior fold of the broad ligament and contains the ovarian vessels.\n\n \u25cf Round ligament: it originates from the uterine horns (point of union of the uterine tube with the uterus), it ascends into the deep inguinal ring and passes through the inguinal canal where it then reaches and attaches to the labia majora. This ligamnet maintains the anteversion position of the uterus.\n\n - Uterine tubes: are a pair of fibro-muscular tubes that arise from the postero-superior part of the uterine fundus and extend postero-laterally to the lateral pelvic wall where its distal part lies in close proximity with the ovaries. they are divided into three parts:\n \u25cf Isthmus: it is the proximal part of the uterine tube and shows an opening into the superior lumen of the uterus, it is the most narrowed part of the uterine tube.\n\n \u25cf Ampulla: is the second part of the uterus and lies distal to the isthmus, it is more dilated than the isthmus and shows slight tortuosity along its course. The ampulla is where fertilization between the female egg and male sperm occurs.\n\n \u25cf Infundibulum: is the most distal and most dilated part of the uterine tube, it exhibits multiple hair-like fibro-muscular projections called the fimbirea which among all, lies one that is the closest to the ovary. The long fimbria beats in a wavy form during ovulation and sweeps the released egg into the uterine tube.\n\n - Ovary: is an almond shaped organ (with its pointed surface aiming laterally) that lies in the ovarian fossa and is suspended by the ovarian ligament which arises from the superior lateral surface of the uterus and connects to the medial pole of the ovary and by the suspensory ligament of the ovary which rises from the lateral abdominal wall and connects to the lateral pole of the ovary. The ovary is lined by simple cuboidal cells (germinal epithelium) which underneath it lies a dense and a firmly adherent covering called the tunica albuginiea.\n\n - Blood supply of the female genitalia:\n \u25cf Vagina: is supplied by three branches (superior, middle and inferior) of the vaginal artery which arises from the internal iliac artery.\n\n \u25cf Cervix: receives blood supply from the descending branch of the uterine artery.\n\n \u25cf Uterus: the inferior and lower middle parts of the uterus are supplied by the uterine artery which arises from the internal iliac artery whereas the upper middle and superior (along with the fundus) parts of the uterus are supplied by the ovarian artery. The uterine artery and the ovarian artery connect with one another at the middle lateral surface of the uterus.\n\n \u25cf Uterine tube: is supplied by the ovarian artery which is a direct branch of the abdominal aorta.\n\n \u25cf Ovary: the ovary is supplied by the ovarian artery.\n\n\"",

      "\"description_malignancies_renal\" : \"\n - Renal cell carcinoma: are a group of malignancies that involve the renal parenchyma and intra-renal structures. A common presentation of renal cell carcinoma is the classic triad of flank pain, frank bloody urine, and a palpable mass at the costro-phrenic angle upon bimanual palpation of the kidneys. This condition is diagnosed by urine analysis, cystoscopy, CT-KUB and gold-standard kidney biopsy.\n\n \u25cf Clear cell carcinoma: originating from the epithelial lining of the proximal renal tubules, it remains the commonest renal cell cancer and characterized as being aggressive and of a poor prognosis. Under microscopy it is identified as a nest of cells with clear cytoplasm and hyperchromatic nuclei. This tumor can be sporadic or heridetary (unclear inheritance pattern) and the latter expresses a genetic abnormality of the von-hippel-lindau gene (VHL syndrome). Management of this condition includes combined chemotherapy but gold-standard is nephrectomy.\n\n \u25cf Papillary cell carcinoma: originating from the epithelial lining of the distal convoluted tubule and is furthered divided into PAP-1 and PAP-2. PAP-1 is characterized by the microscopic features of basophillic cells with scant cytoplasm and hyperchromatic nuclei arranged in spindle-form pattern while PAP-2 shows eosinophilic cells with abundant cytoplasm, hyperchromatic nuclei, and prominent nucleoli. This condition can be sporadic or heridetary and the latter expresses a genetic abnormality of the MET gene, a condition of autosomal dominant inheritance. Management of this condition includes radiation therapy but nephrectomy remains the gold-standard.\n\n \u25cf Medullary cell carcinoma: originates from the epithelial lining of the distal renal collecting duct, is an aggressive tumor that is found to be arising more in individuals with sickle cell disease. It is characterized by the microscopic features of pleomorphic cells arranged in sheets with hyperchromatic nuclei along with the negative expression of the INI-1 protein on immuno-histo-chemistry testing. Management of this condition is yet to be determined as this tumor is unpredictably aggressive.\n\n \u25cf Chromophobe cell carcinoma: originates from the epithelial lining of the distal convoluted tubule, is the least aggressive malignancy amongst the subtypes of renal cell carcinomas.

      "\"description_gas_transport\" : \"\n Gases present in the blood are of three entities, those that are bound to plasma proteins and hemoglobin, the ones that dissolve in the blood and plasma to create a partial pressure, and the ones that get modified into other chemicals but essentially can revert to their original compounds.\n\n - Oxygen: the majority of oxygen in the blood is bound to the hemoglobin of the RBCs (each RBC carries four molecules of O2) while only a minority of O2 is dissolved in the blood to create a partial pressure. Note that O2 is never modified in the blood like other gases such as CO2.\n\n - Carbon dioxide: the majority of CO2 is carried in the RBCs as a modified chemical compound called bicarbonate, this process is carried out through a reversible reaction that carries out the conversion of CO2 via the enzyme carbonic anhydrase, a reaction carried in RBCs. CO2 and water are used together by carbonic anhydrase to form carbonic acid which is then dissociated into bicarbonate and a hydrogen proton, the bicarbonate in carried out of the cell in exchange of a chloride ion (maintaining the cell's charge equilibrium) and the hydrogen ion binds to hemoglobin H (deoxyhemoglobin) so it won't increase the PH within the cell as this has a negative effect on oxygen. CO2 also binds to carbohemoglobin in minimal amounts as if it were to bing in larger amounts it would have a negative effect on O2 binding to hemoglobin. Another form of CO2 present in the blood is the dissolved form which produces the partial pressure of CO2.\n\n \u2713 The affinity of oxygen by which it binds to the hemoglobin of red blood cells is determined by four factors, temperature, acidity, CO2, and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate where an imbalance in one of these factors could result in a negative (shift to the right) or a positive (shift to the left) effect on O2 affinity.\n\n - Factors resulting in decreased/negative O2 affinity:\n \u25cf High temperature: increased temperature denatures hemoglobin and with out its normal form, hemoglobin won't be able to bind O2 molecules, it will even unload the O2 molecules it holds since it figure is no longer compatible with carrying oxygen.\n\n \u25cf Acidity: the increase in hydrogen protons acidifies the red blood cell causing a change in the amino acid sequence configuration of hemoglobin thus rendering the latter incompatible to binding O2.\n\n \u25cf CO2: Increased levels of carbon dioxide (faced with decreased levels of O2) provides more CO2 molecules that bind to hemoglobin, this lowers oxygen affinity towards hemoglobin, a phenomenon known as the Bohr effect. Moreover, when less O2 is bound to hemoglobin, this increases the affinity of CO2 towards hemoglobin, a phenomenon known as the Haldane effect.\n\n \u25cf 2,3-diphosphoglycerate: increased levels of 2,3-DPG causes the latter to bind to hemoglobin and resulting in the detachment of O2 molecules from their hemoglobin binding site by changing the shape of the hemoglobin making it incompatible with carrying oxygen, increased levels of 2,3-DPG are commonly seen in hypoxia.\n\n - Factors resulting in increased/positive O2 affinity:\n \u25cf Low temperature: decreased temperature provides the hemoglobin a stronger form thus it is able to have a firmer grip on O2 at its binding site.\n\n \u25cf Increased PH: the decrease in hydrogen protons put the red blood cell in a base environment rendering the hemoglobin a stronger structure thus O2 affinity increases.\n\n \u25cf CO2: decreased levels of carbon dioxide means less CO2 molecules binding to hemoglobin, this increases oxygen affinity towards hemoglobin.\n\n \u25cf 2,3-diphosphoglycerate: decreased levels of 2,3-DPG increases the affinity of O2 to hemoglobin since its shape will remain the same and devoid of the shape changing effects of 2,3-DPG.\n\n\"",
      "\"description_hypothalamus_pituitary_axis\" : \"\n The pituitary gland is connected to the hypothalmus by the a stalk called the infundibulum, a structure that holds with in it the hypophyseal-hypothalamic portal vessels.\n\n The hypothalamus synthesizes and releases a group of hormones that function in stimulating or inhibiting the release of hormones from the pituitary gland. These hormones are shuttled to the pituitary gland through circulation via the hypothalamic-hypophyseal portal vessels (to the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland) or via axons originating in the hypothalamus (to the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland).\n\n - Hormones stimulating the anterior pituitary gland:\n \u25cf Growth hormone releasing hormone: secreted by the hypothalamus, GHRH travels through the hypothalamic-hypophysial portal vessels to reach the anterior pituitary gland where it binds to the somatotropes in the latter to stimulate the secretion of growth hormone. This mechanism occurs when GHRH binds to the G-protein coupled receptors on the somatotropes membrane activiating the alpha-subunit of the receptor and converting the pre-attached GDP to GTP, the activated alpha-subunit then binds to and up-regulates phospholipase-C in the cell membrane. Once up-regulated, phospholipase-C then cleaves the phospholipid PIP2 into diacylglycerol and IP3 where IP3 stimulates the release of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum and both diacylglycerol and calcium act activate protein kinase-C which carries eventually stimulates the release of GHRH from the somatotropes.\n\n \u25cf Thyroid releasing hormone: secreted by the hypothalamus, TRH travels through the hypothalamic-hypophysial portal vessels to reach the anterior pituitary gland where it binds to the thyrotropes in the latter to stimulate the secretion of thyroid stimulating hormone. This mechanism occurs when TRH binds to the G-protein coupled receptors on the somatotropes membrane activating the alpha-subunit of the receptor and converting the pre-attached GDP to GTP, the activated alpha-subunit then binds to and up-regulates phospholipase-C in the cell membrane. Once up-regulated, phospholipase-C then cleaves the phospholipid PIP2 into diacylglycerol and IP3 where IP3 stimulates the release of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum and both diacylglycerol and calcium act activate protein kinase-C which eventually stimulates the release of TRH from the thyrotropes.\n\n \u25cf Gondatropin releasing hormone: secreted by the hypothalamus, GnRH travels through the hypothalamic-hypophysial portal vessels to reach the anterior pituitary gland where it binds to the gonadotropes in the latter to stimulate the secretion of leutinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone. This mechanism occurs when GnRH binds to the G-protein coupled receptors on the somatotropes membrane activating the alpha-subunit of the receptor and converting the pre-attached GDP to GTP, the activated alpha-subunit then binds to and up-regulates phospholipase-C in the cell membrane. Once up-regulated, phospholipase-C then cleaves the phospholipid PIP2 into diacylglycerol and IP3 where IP3 stimulates the release of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum and both diacylglycerol and calcium act activate protein kinase-C which eventually stimulates the release of leutinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone from the gonadotropes.\n\n \u25cf Corticotropin releasing hormone: secreted by the hypothalamus, CRH travels through the hypothalamic-hypophysial portal vessels to reach the anterior pituitary gland where it binds to the corticotropes in the latter to stimulate the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone. This mechanism occurs when CRH binds to the G-protein coupled receptors on the corticotropes membrane activating the alpha-subunit of the receptor and converting the pre-attached GDP to GTP, the activated alpha-subunit then binds to and up-regulates adenylyl cyclase resulting in the over-expression of cyclic-AMP (by converting ATP to cAMP), cAMP then proceeds to the activation of phosphokinase-A which eventually carries out the stimulation of corticotropes for the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH).\n\n - Hormones inhibiting the anterior pituitary gland:\n \u25cf Dopamine: secreted by the hypothalamus, dopamine travels through the hypothalamic-hypophysial portal vessels to reach the anterior pituitary gland where it binds to the lactotropes in the latter to inhibit the secretion of prolactin, a hormone responsible for the formation of breast milk. Dopamine binds to the G-protein coupled receptors on the lactotropes cell membrane and activiting the alpha-subunit of the receptor and converting the pre-attached GDP to GTP, the activated alpha-subunit then binds to and up-regulates adenylyl cyclase resulting in the over-expression of cyclic-AMP (by converting ATP to cAMP), cAMP then proceeds to the activation of protein kinase-A which eventually carries out the inhibition of lactotropes thus inhibiting the secretion of prolactin.\n\n \u25cf Somatostatin: secreted by the hypothalamus, somatostatin travels through the hypothalamic-hypophysial portal vessels to reach the anterior pituitary gland where it binds to the somatotropes receptor as a competing antagonist thereby inhibiting the function of GHRH in the anterior pituitary gland.\n\n - Hormones secreted by the posterior piuitary lobe:\n \u25cf Anti-diuretic hormone: synthesized by the supra-optic nuclei in the hypothalamus, ADH hormone while bound to neurophysin-2 (a carrier protein) is carried along the axons extending from the hypothalamus and traveling to the posterior pituitary lobe via the hypothalamic-hypophysial tract that passes through the infundibulum. In the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland, the nerve endings of these axons are seen as bulbs that store and secrete the hormone via exocytosis upon stimulation and once secreted, ADH hormone dissociated from its carrier protein.\n\n \u25cf Oxytocin: synthesized by the para-ventricular nuclei in the hypothalamus, oxytocin hormone while bound to neurophysin-1 (a carrier protein) is carried along the axons extending from the hypothalamus and traveling to the posterior pituitary lobe via the hypothalamic-hypophysial tract that passes through the infundibulum.

      "\"description_dsc_spinal_tract_physio\" : \"\n Descending tracts of the spinal cord:\n \u25cf Corticospinal tracts: responsible for rapid skillful voluntary movements. Its fibers are originate from different areas of the cerebral cortex where one-third originates from the primary motor cortex (precentral gyrus), one-third from the secondary motor cortex (precentral gyrus) and one-third from the parietal lobe (postcentral gyrus). The descending fibers converge in the corona radiata and pass through the posterior limb of the internal capsule. In the posterior limb of the internal capsule the fibers are arranged in a way that the closest to the genu are the cervical portions of the body while the posterior ones are the lower extremity fibers. The tract continues through the middle peduncles of the midbrain, at this point the fibers lying medially are concerned with the cervical portions of the body and those lying laterally are concerned with the leg. When the tract enters the pons it gets broken down into numerous bundles by the transverse pontocerebellar fibers and in the medulla oblongata the fibers are grouped together along the anterior border to form a swelling called a pyramid (another name given to the corticospinal tract is the pyramidal tract). At the junction of the medulla and spinal cord most of the fibers cross (decussation of the pyramids) to the opposite side to the lateral white column of the spinal cord to form the lateral corticospinal tract (descends along the entire length of the spinal cord and terminate in the anterior gray column of all spinal cord segments) as for the fibers that did not cross at the deccusation of the pyramids they descend in the anterior white column of the spinal cord forming the anterior corticospinal tract which eventually would cross to the opposite side and terminate in the anterior gray column of the spinal cord (C1-T6 segments). Most corticospinal fibers synapse with alpha and gamma motor neurons.\n\n - Reticulospinal tract: influences voluntary movement and reflex activity via specific neurons in the midbrain, pons and medulla oblongata called reticular formation. In the pons the reticular formation sends axons that do not cross down into the spinal cord known as the pontine reticulospinal tract (descends through the anterior white column) and from the medulla oblongata these axons are called the medullary reticulospinal tract (descends through the lateral white column). Both tracts enter the anterior gray column of the spinal cord.\n\n - Tectospinal tract: responsible for reflex postural movement in response to visual stimuli in other words moving the eye and head towards the source of stimulus. Fibers originating from the superior colliclus of the midbrain cross to the opposite side to descend through the brain stem in the anterior white column of the spinal cord terminating in the anterior gray column of the upper cervical segments of the spinal cord by synapsing with interneurons.\n\n - Rubrospinal tract: facilitate the activity of flexor muscles and inhibit the activity of the extensor muscles. This tract first begins with fibers descending from the cerebral cortex and cerebellum to the red nucleus located in the tegmentum of the midbrain at the level of the superior colliculus. The red nucleus gives out axons the cross to the opposite side and descend as the rubrospinal tract through the pons and medulla oblongata to continue down the lateral white column of the spinal cord synapsing with interneurons in the anterior gray column of the spinal cord.\n\n - Vestibulospinal tract: facilitate the activity of the extensor muscles and inhibit the activity of the flexor muscles in association with maintaining balance. This tract starts with the vestibular nuclei located in pons and medulla below the floor of the fourth ventricle receiving fibers from the inner ear (via vestibular nerve) and the cerebellum. Neurons of the lateral vestibular nucleus sends axons that form the vestibulospinal tract, they descend with out crossing through the medulla and the entire length of the spinal cord where they eventually synapse with interneurons of the anterior gray column of the spinal cord.\"",

      "\"description_thyroid_gland_hormones\" : \"\n The thyroid hormone is the main hormonal entity responsible for regulating metabolic rate while also providing many different functions that will be discussed in this section.\n\n - Synthesis of thyroid hormone:\n \u25cf The hypothalamus secretes thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) which binds on to the thyrotrope receptors of the anterior pituitary gland.\n\n \u25cf Upon its binding, TRH results in the activation of the G-protein coupled receptor and stimulating the alpha-subunit which in turn up-regulates phospholipase-C and the latter breaks down PIP2 to IP3 and diacylglycerol. IP3 and diacylglycerol increase intracellular calcium levels and up-regulates protein kinase-A which eventually results in the release of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH).\n\n \u25cf TSH travels along the blood stream to bind on to the extracellular receptors of the thyroid follicle. Once TSH binds to its designated receptors, it activates the G-protein coupled receptor then the alpha subunit of the receptor activates adenylyl cyclase which up-regulates cAMP that activates protein kinase C as the latter is required for phosphorylation and secretion of thyroglobulin.\n\n \u25cf Iodide being an essential molecule in thyroid hormone synthesis is present in the blood and enters the thyroid follicle through a sodium-iodide symporter. Once entered the follicle, it now needs to enter the colloid of the area of the thyroid and it does so by passing through a chloride-iodide counter-transport channel called pendrin.\n\n \u25cf Once entered the colloid, the enzyme thyroid peroxidase removes the negative charge of iodide and converts it to the null charged iodine.\n\n \u24cf Thyroid peroxidase also catalyzes the binding of iodine to the amino acid tyrosine of the thyroglobulin where two iodine molecules can bind to a tyrosine molecule and forming a di-iodotyrosine or one molecule can bind to a tyrosine molecule giving mono-iodotyrosine.\n\n \u25cf Once the iodine molecules bind to the tyrosin amino acid, thyroid peroxidase then couples two di-iodotyrosine molecules into forming thyroxine (T4; since four iodine molecules are bound together) and couples one di-iodotyrosine molecule with one mono-iodotyrosine molecule into forming tri-iodothyronine (T3), this coupling process marks the formation of the thyroid hormones T3 and T4.\n\n \u25cf After coupling has occurred, the thyroid hormones T3 and T4 need to be detached from tyrosine in order to be released into the blood. The mono/di-iodotyrosine complexes are absorbed into the thyroid follicle by endocytosis and placed into a vesicle that fuses with a lysosome (an enzyme-containing vesicle) where the lysosomal protease enzymes break down the tyrosine and cleave its bondage with T3 and T4.\n\n \u25cf After the release of T3 and T4 from tyrosine, they are situated into a vesicle and secreted into the blood stream by exocytosis.\n\n \u25cf In the blood stream both T3 and T4 bind to plasma proteins such as albumin and thyroxine-binding protein, respectively.\n\n \u2713 It should be noted that T3 is more potent but acquire a lesser affinity than T4 and that the majority of thyroxine stored in the tissues is converted to T3.\n\n - Mechanism of action of thyroid hormones:\n \u25cf Cellular basic function: as T4 passes through the cell membrane it is converted by 5-de-iodinase to T3 that is the active form of the thyroid hormone complex, T3 and retinoic acid bind to and activate the transcription factors causing them to enter the nucleus where they go through translation via mRNA, this results in the over expression of 3NA-2K ATPase membrane channels and increase cellular ATP utilization. Since ATP is over utilized by the 3NA-2K ATPase channel membranes its resources are depleted, this in turn forces the body to produce more ATP thus increasing the metabolic rate and heat generation simultaneously. Another major intracellular function of thyroid hormone is the action it exerts on the mitochondria which is over-working the mitochondria with the excess ATP utilization that the mitochondria has to go through hypertrophy and hyperplasia in order to keep up with the cellular metabolic rate.\n\n \u25cf Central nervous system: thyroid hormone is crucial to the growth and development of the central nervous system as it increases dendrite formation and along with that accompanies increased synaptogenesis. Since there is increased dendrites and synapses among neurones, impulse conduction must keep up with these changes therefore thyroid hormone also stimulates the production of the myelin sheath over the axons.\n\n \u25cf Heart: thyroid hormone exerts positive intotropic, chronotropic, and dromotropic effects on the heart by binding to cardiac muscle cells and the SA and AV nodes, this results in the over expression of type-1 beta-adrenergic receptors thus increasing the surface area of catecholamine binding such as epinephrine which increases contractility and simultaneously cardiac output along with the increased excitation of the SA and AV node which increases heart rate as the net effect of thyroid hormone over the cardiovascular system is increasing the blood pressure.\n\n \u25cf Alimentary canal: thyroid hormone significantly contributes to intestinal motility by stimulating contraction of smooth muscles thereby enhancing the peristaltic movement of the intestines. Another function thyroid hormone is concerned about that is stimulating secretory glands to release their contents into the intestinal lumen to stabilize intestinal contents and provide smooth passage along the intestinal lumen.\n\n \u25cf Gross metabolic effects: T3 and T4 exert the same function in the liver which is glycogenolysis that is the breaking down of glycogen to glucose and increasing the glucose levels in the blood. It also stimulates the process of gluconeogenesis by utilizing fats, lactic acid and proteins by converting them to glucose. Thyroid hormone also stimulates lipolysis by activating the lipase enzyme in adipose tissues and breaking down fat into glycerol which is utilized in the liver for gluconeogenesis and fatty acids. In addition to lipolyis stimulation, thyroid hormone stimulates the over expression of LDL receptors on the liver thus removing excess low desnsity lipoproteins from the blood stream.\n\n \u25cf Bone: thyroid hormone functions in bone remodelling by regulating the action of osteoblasts and osteoclasts, it is also concerned with endo-chondral ossification (converting the hyaline cartilage to bone) thus promoting bone growth. Thyroid hormone also acts over the epiphyseal plates (the hyaline cartilage) and resulting in hypertrophy and hyperplasia of chondrocytes thus promoting interstitial bone growth.\n\n \u25cf Muscles: thyroid hormone increases protein synthesis and in the muscle tissue as it regulates both protein anabolism and catabolism in order to maintain muscle growth and integrity. The effect of thyroid hormone on skeletal muscles is markedly evident during hyperthyroidism where excess thyroid hormone promotes catabolism of muscle proteins rendering the skeletal muscles weakness and hypotrophy.\n\n\"",

      "\"description_renal_clearance\" : \"\n Renal clearance describes the amount of a substance completely removed from the plasma per minute, it is a strong indicator of renal efficacy in filtration therefore it is used to measure the glomerular filtration rate of different substances by calculating their clearance ratio.\n\n \u2713 Different substances could be used to measure renal through GFR but many are not able to provide an accurate estimate and so only two markers are used, they are inulin and creatinine.\n\n - Inulin: is a naturally occurring polysaccharide used to measure renal clearance through its intra-venous administration. Inulin is a unique marker in that it is completely filtered through the glomerulus and is neither absorbed nor secreted along the renal tubular apparatus (i.e completely removed from the plasma and fully excreted in urine) thus making it a perfect marker for the estimation of the GFR. A downside of inulin however, it is rarely involved in clinical practice, therefore a less specific and readily available marker is sought, that is creatinine.\n\n - Creatinine: is a by-product of skeletal muscle metabolism resulting from degradation of the protein creatine during muscle activity, this nitrogenous compound is widely used in clinical practice as a biomarker to estimate GFR. A downside of creatinine however, though it is filtered and not reabsorbed by the tubules, small amounts are secreted by the tubules thus making the end-volume of creatinine slightly higher than the amount initially filtered. Since scant amounts of creatinine are secreted by the tubules, this increase in end-volume is negligible.\n\n \u2713 Renal clearance only happens if sufficient amounts of plasma pass by the glomerulus to be filtered and since we can estimate GFR by creatinine and inulin, a different substance is used to estimate the amount of plasma flowing through the glomerulus and that substance is para-aminohippuric acid.\n\n - Para-aminohippuric acid (PAH): is a synthetic derivative of hippuric acid (naturally found in urine) and is used in the estimation of renal plasma flow. Like inulin, PAH is not naturally present in the body and is administered via the intra-venous route. Moreover, it is completely filtered at the glomerulus and secreted by the tubules but is not absorbed by the latter thus providing an almost accurate estimate of renal plasma flow.\n\n\"",

The spinal lemniscus then ascends from the medulla through the posterior part of the pons where it reaches the tegmentum of the midbrain (anterior part of mid brain, posterior part of midbrain is called tectum) lying lateral to the medial lemniscus. The fibers of the lateral spinothalamic tract then synapse in the ventral posterolateral nucleus (VPLN) of the thalamus (third order neuron), here crude pain (non-localized pain) is felt. Axons of the third order neuron in the ventral posterolateral nucleus of the thalamus send axons that pass through the posterior limb of the internal capsule and corona radiata to reach the postcentral gyrus of the cerebral cortex (part of the brain that receives sensory input). Damage to this pathway causes contralateral loss of pain and temperature sensation below the level of the lesion.\n\n - Anterior spinothalamic tract: is the light touch and pressure pathway, axons from the posterior root ganglion (1st order neuron) enter the spinal cord and continue to the tip of the posterior gray column and synapse in the substantia gelatinosa (2nd order neuron), then axons from the substantia gelatinosa cross obliquely to the contralateral side and ascend in the opposite anterolateral white column as the anterior spinothalamic tract to the medulla where it accompanies the lateral spinothalamic tract and the spinotectal tract. As mentioned previously the three tracts form the spinal lemniscus where the spinal lemniscus ascends to the posterior part of the pons, the tegmentum of the midbrain and eventually synapses in the VPLN of the thalamus (3rd order neuron) where crude touch and pressure are sensed here. Axons from the VPLN in the thalamus pass through the posterior limb of the internal capsule and the corona radiata to reach the postcentral gyrus of the cerebral cortex (part of the brain that receives sensory input). Damage to this tract causes contralateral loss of light/crude and pressure sensations below the level of the lesion.\n\n - Posterior white column: discriminative touch, vibration and conscious muscle joint sensations. The axons from the posterior root ganglion (1st order neuron) enter the spinal cord and continue directly to the posterior white column of the same side (axons do not cross) where they then ascend as the fasciculus gracilis (present along the entire length of the spinal cord) and fasciculus cuneatus (only present from C1-T6) with gracilis lying medially and cuneatus lying laterally and both are separated from each other by a septum. Axons of the fasciculus gracilis and fasciculus cuneatus ascend ispilaterally to terminate in the nucleus gracilis and cuneatus (2nd order neuron) of the medulla. Nucleus gracilis and cuneatus of the medulla sends axons called internal arcuate fibers which cross to the other side of the medulla (this crossing is called sensory decussation) and ascend as a single bundle which is called the medial lemniscus through the medulla, pons and midbrain to terminate in the VPLN of the thalamus (3rd order neuron). The VPLN of the thalamus sends axons through the posterior limb of the internal capsule and corona radiata to reach the postcentral gyrus of the cerebral cortex. Numerous axons of the fasciculus cuneatus from C1-T6, after terminating in the nucleus cuneatus (2nd order neuron) enter the cerebellum through the inferior cerebellar peduncle of the same side (cuneocerebellar tract) via posterior external arcuate fibers that transmit sensory information of muscle joint. Damage to this tract causes loss of discriminative touch, proprioceptive sensation (sensory ataxia), and vibratory sensations.\n\n - Posterior spinocerebellar tract: senses muscle joints and sends perceived information to the cerebellum. First lets get clear on a simple concept, the second order neuron involved in this tract is the nucleus dorsalis which extends only from C8 to L4, now that we got that out of the way, here is how we see the concept being applied. Impulses from the muscle joint (muscle spindles, tendon organs and joint receptors of the trunk and lower limb) enter the posterior root ganglion (first order neuron) then it enters the posterior gray horn of the spinal cord to synapse with the nucleus dorsalis which sends axons to the posterolateral part of the lateral white column of the same side, then these axons ascend as the posterior spinocerebellar tract to the medulla oblongata. From the medulla oblongata the tract enters the cerebellum through the inferior cerebellum peduncle, it does not continue to the cerebrum because of the fact that we mentioned earlier that the nucleus dorasalis only extends from C8-L4. The cerebellum uses the information for coordinating limb movements and maintaining posture.\n\n - Anterior spinocerebellar tract: impulses from the muscle joint receptors (muscle spindles, tendon organs and joint receptors of upper limb, lower limb and trunk) enter the posterior root ganglion then the posterior gray horn to synapse with the nucleus dosalis whose axons (majority of them) cross to the opposite side and ascend as the anterior spinocerebellar tract in the contralateral white column passing through the medulla and pons to enter the cerebellum via the superior cerebellar peduncle and with in the cerebellum the contralateral (crossing) fibers cross back to their original side.\n\n - Spinotectal tract: responsible for spinovisual reflexes moving the head and eye towards the source of stimulus (when you step on a nail you react to the pain generated by the nail through the spinotectal tract). Impulses travel from the receptor to the posterior root ganglion then enter the dorsal gray horn of the spinal cord to synapse to an unknown nucleus which sends axons that cross to the opposite side to the anterolateral white column and ascending as the spinotectal tract passing through the medulla oblongata and pons, eventually synapsing with neurons in the superior colliculus of the midbrain.\n\n - Spionreticular tract: sends impulses to the reticular formation which has an important role in consciousness. Axons from the receptor travel to the posterior root ganglion and synapse to an unknown second neuron in the gray matter of the spinal cord which sends ascending axons (does not cross) from the lateral white column as the spinoreticular tract to synapse with neurons of the reticular formation in the medulla oblongata, pons and midbrain.\n\n - Spino-olivary tract: sends information from skin and proprioceptive organs to the cerebellum. Impulses from the receptor travel to the posterior root ganglion to synapse to an unknown second neuron in the posterior gray matter of the spinal cord which sends axons that cross to the opposite side to ascend as the spino-olivary tract from the junction of the anterior and lateral white columns to synapse in the olivary nuclei (third order neuron) in the medulla oblongata, the reticular nuclei send axons to the which cross to the original side to enter the cerebellum through the inferior cerebellum peduncle.\n\n\"",

      "\"description_renal_bloodflow\" : \"\n The kidneys receive blood from the heart's cardiac output through the parallel vascular domain (see physiology of the heart - blood and fluid pressure section) where approximately 20-25% of the cardiac output is directed towards the kidney that is about roughly 1100-1900L per day.\n\n Renal blood flow is what determines the final outcome of the glomerular filtration rate, intuitively, the more blood received by the glomerulus the more filtration occurs. Since the volume of blood is continuously maintained to the kidney by autoregulation (will be discussed later in the chapter) the changes in renal blood flow to the glomerulus are a result of different agents acting locally at the glomerular level but are exerting their function on the afferent and efferent arterioles; the afferent arterioles bring blood to the glomerular tuft of capillaries and the efferent areterioles carry blood away from the glomerular tuft of capillaries and into the peritubular vasculature.\n\n - Factors that have been strongly linked to changing renal blood flow:\n \u25cf Catecholamines (nore/epinephrine): both the afferent and efferent arterioles are heavily equipped with alpha-1 receptors that respond to catecholamines that are released in high amounts when the sympathetic system is strongly activated, this results in a strong activation of the alpha-1 receptors and increased constriction of the renal arterioles thus decreased renal blood flow to the glomerulus which in turn results in a decreased glomerular filtration rate.\n\n \u25cf Prostaglandins: biological infammatory mediators such as prostaglandins result in local vasodilation of the renal arterioles thus resulting in an increased renal blood flow and an increased glomerular filtration rate. It should be noted that although prostaglandins are vasodilators and increase renal blood flow they do not normally contribute to a high increase in glomerular filtration as physiologically they are released in response of an abundance in a constricting agent in order to oppose that agent's constricting mechanism and maintain renal blood flow.\n\n \u25cf Endothelin: produced by the vascular endothelial cells when damaged or in response to the presence of cytokines, is a potent vasoconstrictor when produced in abundance. Endothilin acts on the G-protein coupled receptors of the renal arterioles resulting in marked vasoconstriction thus decreasing renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate.\n\n \u25cf Nitric oxide: released by the vascular endothelial cells, is a potent vasodilator of both afferent and efferent arterioles thus increasing renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate.\n\n \u25cf Atrial natriuretic peptide: released by the cardiac atrial cells in response to high blood pressure, is a potent vasodilator of the renal afferent arteriole and exhibits mild vasoconstrictor activity on the efferent arteriole, this allows for increased renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate since blood spends more time in the glomerular capillary tuft as the efferent arteriole is constricted and less blood is being carried away.\n\n \u25cf Angiotensin-2: a highly potent vasoconstrictor of both the afferent and efferent arteriole, is released in response to decreased arterial pressure (either blood volume or oxygen saturation) to produce vasoconstriction that would in turn raise blood pressure. Although it is a vasoconstrictor, angiotensin-2 has a higher affinity to act upon the efferent renal arteriole rather than the afferent arteriole meaning that when not present in abdunance, it could slightly increase the glomerular filtration rate as blood spends more time in the glomerular capillary tuft since the efferent arteriole is more constricted than the afferent arteriole and less blood is carried away.\n\n \u25cf Dopamine: is an agent that is capable of rendering the renal arterioles vasodilation and vasoconstriction. When present at low levels dopamine is able to act on both the afferent and efferent renal arterioles resulting in vasodilation thus increasing renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate but when present in abundance it causes vasoconstriction of both afferent and efferent arterioles thus decreasing renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate.\n\n - Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system:\n 1: the decrease in arterial renal pressure whether it be due to hypoperfusion or a decrease in oxygen saturation stimulates the mechano-receptors and chemo-receptors of the juxtamedullary apparatus to release an enzyme called Renin.\n\n 2: Renin acts on angiotensinogen (a globulin synthesized dominantly by the liver and is found freely in plasma) converting the latter to angiotensin-1. Angiotensin-1 is a peptide of little effect and has to be converted to the highly potent form of angiotensin, that is angiotensin-2.\n\n 3: The conversion from angiotensin-1 to angiotensin-2 is carried out in the lungs and kidneys by the angiotensin-converting enzyme.\n\n 4: Angiotensin-2 exerts its function on the kidney by acting on the sodium-hydrogen ATPase pump of the convoluted tubules (preferentially the proximal convoluted tubule) to reabsorb sodium and secrete hydrogen protons (whenever sodium is absorbed, water follows).\n\n 5: Angiotensin-2 also stimulates the release of the anti-diuretic hormone from the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland (for anti-diuretic hormone function, see endocrine physiology - posterior pituitary hormones section).\n\n 6: Angiotensin-2 also stimulates the adrenal glands to release aldosterone which results in further sodium reabsorption from the convoluted tubules (preferentially the distal convoluted tubule) and the collecting ducts.\n\n \u2713 The kidneys maintain a constant blood flow despite drastic changes in systemic blood pressure through Autoregulation, a phenomenon comprising of two mechanisms; tubuloglomerular feedback and myogenic response.\n\n - Mechanisms of autoregulation:\n \u25cf Tubuloglomerular feedback: the macula densa which is a collection of specialized epithelial cells located at the first part of the distal convoluted tubule are highly sensitive to sodium level and blood volume as when both parameters decease the macula densa stimulated the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in order to restore normal levels and correct the defect in sodium level and blood volume thereby maintaining the glomerular filtration rate.\n\n \u25cf Myogenic response: when blood pressure rises it causes the blood vessels to stretch due to the high hydrostatic pressure being applies against the vessel walls, this stretching of the walls triggers a reactive response where the endothelial cells of the vessel contract in order to counteract the dilation/stretching of the vessel wall. This reaction is carried out by the increased influx of calcium once the vessels are stretched causing reactive contraction of the vessel walls.\n\n\"",

      "\"description_androgen_synthesis\" : \"\n The male and female androgens are synthesized in the testis and ovaries respectively, but one common place where androgens are synthesized is the adrenal medulla, specifically the zona reticularis. This section will discuss the synthesis of gonadal androgens and adrenal androgens.\n\n - Synthesis of adrenal testosterone:\n \u25cf Upon stimulation from the ACTH hormone secreted by the anterior pituitary gland, the receptors of the zona reticularis are activated (G-protein coupled receptors), they then initiate intracellular changes via the adenylyl cyclase pathway where the end result is the phosphorylation and activation of the enzyme cholesterol mono-oxygenase which converts cholesterol to pregnenolone.\n\n \u25cf Pregnenolone is then converted by the enzyme 17-alpha-hydroxylase to 17-hydroxypregnenolone.\n\n \u25cf 17-hydroxypregnenolone is then converted by the enzyme 17,20 desmolase to dehydro-epi-androsterone (DHEA).\n\n \u25cf DHEA is then converted by the enzyme 3-beta-hydroxy-steroid-dehydrogenase to androstenedione.\n\n \u25cf Androstenedione then can continue down two pathways as it can be converted to estrone or testosterone. The enzyme 17-beta-hydroxy-steroid-dehydrogenase converts androstenedione to testosterone.\n\n \u25cf Testosterone itself is not fully functional thereby is unable to establish the desired end organ effect therefore it has tp beconverted to its active form.\n\n \u25cf The dihydrotestosterone is the active form of testosterone and is majorly converted from testosterone in the desired end organs by the enzyme 5-alpha-reductase.\n\n - Synthesis of adrenal estrogen/estradiol:\n \u25cf Upon stimulation from the ACTH hormone secreted by the anterior pituitary gland, the receptors of the zona reticularis are activated (G-protein coupled receptors), they then initiate intracellular changes via the adenylyl cyclase pathway where the end result is the phosphorylation and activation of the enzyme cholesterol mono-oxygenase which converts cholesterol to pregnenolone.\n\n \u25cf Pregnenolone is then converted by the enzyme 3-beta-hydroxy-steroid-dehydrogenase to progesterone.\n\n \u25cf Progesterone now is being acted upon by the enzyme 17-alpha-hydroxylase to be converted to 17-hydroxy-progesterone.\n\n \u25cf The enzyme 17,20-desmolase then catalyzes the conversion of 17-hydroxy-progesterone to androstenedione where at this stage the latter can be converted to either testosterone through the previously described pathway or it would be acted upon by the enzyme aromatase to be converted to estrone.\n\n \u25cf The enzyme 17-beta-hydroxy-steroid-dehydrogenase acts upon estrone and catalyzing its conversion to estradiol, the active form of estrogen.\n\n \u2713 Testosterone can also be converted to estradiol via the catalyzing effect of the enzyme aromatase.\n\n - Synthesis of gonadal testosterone:\n \u25cf like in the adrenal gland, cholesterol remains the precursor of testosterone where it is acted upon by the enzyme desmolase which catalyzes its conversion to pregnenolone.\n\n At this stage, the pathway of cholesterol synthesis is similar to that of the zona reticularis of the adrenal medulla where pregnenolone is converted to 17-hydroxy-pregnenolone by the enzyme 17-alpha-hydroxylase.\n\n \u25cf The pathway continues as 17-hydroxy-pregnenolone is acted upon by the enzyme 17,20-desmolase thus catalyzing its conversion to DHEA.\n\n \u25cf DHEA then is converted by 3-beta-hydroxy-steroid dehydrogenase to androstenedione.\n\n \u25cf Androstenedione is now being converted via the catalyzing effect of 17-beta-hydroxy-steroid-dehydrogenase to testosterone.\n\n \u25cf Then testosterone is converted to its active form di-hydro-testosterone in the target organs by the enzyme 5-alpha-reductase.\n\n - Synthesis of gonadal estrogen/estradiol:\n \u25cf Like in the adrenal gland, cholesterol remains the precursor of testosterone where it is acted upon by the enzyme desmolase which catalyzes its conversion to pregnenolone.\n\n At this stage, the pathway of cholesterol synthesis is similar to that of the zona reticularis of the adrenal medulla where pregnenolone is converted to 17-hydroxy-pregnenolone by the enzyme 17-alpha-hydroxylase. Pregnenolone can also be converted to pregesterone when it is being acted upon by the enzyme 3-beta-hydroxy-steroid-dehydrogenase.\n\n \u25cf The pathway continues as 17-hydroxy-pregnenolone is acted upon by the enzyme 17,20-desmolase thus catalyzing its conversion to DHEA.\n\n \u25cf DHEA then is converted by 3-beta-hydroxy-steroid dehydrogenase to androstenedione.\n\n \u25cf Androstenedione is now being converted via the catalyzing effect of 17-beta-hydroxy-steroid-dehydrogenase to testosterone.\n\n \u25cf The enzyme aromatase converts testosterone to estradiol, the active form of estrogen.\n\n \u2713 It should be noted that LH acts upon the leydig cells of the testes to stimulates the synthesis of testosterone while FSH acts upon the sertoli cells which are specialized in sperm cell production, a process known as spermatogenesis.\n\n\"",
      "\"description_heart_anatomy\" : \"\n The heart is situated in the middle mediastinum and extends from the thoracic vertebrae T5-T8, it is a four-chambered organ that is conical in shape and covered by the pericardium. It is compartmentalized into the endocardium which lines the internal surface of the heart, the myocardium which is the muscular part of the heart, and the epicardium which forms the outer surface of the heart.\n\n - Pericardium: is a double-layered membrane that contains the heart, its first layer being the fibrous pericardium which is a dense, tough, and protective layer whose function is to prevent over-stretching and over-filling of the heart. The second layer is the serous pericardium which is further subdivided into a parietal layer that forms the inner lining of the fibrous pericardium and a visceral layer that is firmly adherent to the surface of the heart. In between the parietal and visceral layers lies a space called the pericardial cavity filled with clear fluid which reduces the friction generated by the heart during its act of pumping blood. The fibrous pericardium and the parietal layer of the serous pericardium receive blood supply from the pericardiophrenic artery and the visceral layer of the serous pericardium receives blood from the coronary arteries that supply the heart. The fibrous layer of the pericardium and the parietal layer of the serous pericardium receives innervation from the phrenic nerve while the visceral layer of the serous pericardium receives innervation from the vagus and sympathetic nerve fibers.\n\n - Surfaces of the heart:\n \u25cf Anterior (sternocostal) surface: is the part of the heart facing the sternum and its is made mostly by the right ventricle, two-third of the left ventricle, the right atrium and its auricle, and the auricle of the left atrium.\n\n \u25cf Posterior (base) surface: formed mostly by the left atrium and the pulmonary veins (the left atrium can't be from the anterior surface because it is hidden behind the vessels emerging from the heart), two-third of the right atrium with the associated inferior and superior vena cava.\n\n \u25cf Inferior (diaphragmatic) surface: is the part of the heard that lies in contact with the diaphragm, it is formed mostly by the posterior surface of the left ventricle and two-third of the posterior surface of the right ventricle.\n\n \u25cf Right surface: is the surface of the heart facing the right lung and is formed by the right atrium.\n\n \u25cf Left surface: is the surface of the heart facing the left lung and is formed by the left ventricle.\n\n - Borders of the heart are features separating the surfaces from one another.\n \u2022 Upper border: is formed by the left atria with a minor contribution from the right atria.\n\n \u2022 Inferior border: is formed by the inferior surface of the right ventricle with a minor contribution from the left ventricle.\n\n \u2022 Left border: is formed by the left ventricle and the auricle of the left atrium.\n\n \u2022 Right border: is formed by the right atrium with a minor contribution from the right ventricle.\n\n - External features of the right atrium:\n \u25cf The right atrium extends from the opening of the superior vena cava which corresponds to the third costal cartilage to the opening of the inferior vena cava which corresponds to the sixth costal cartilage.\n\n \u25cf The right atrium also shows the right auricle, a sharp muscular projection of the right atrium that overhangs the base of the aorta's lateral half.\n\n \u25cf The right atrium also shows the sulcus terminalis (external impression of the crista terminalis) running from at the side of the atrium from the opening of the superior vena cava to that of the inferior vena cava.\n\n - Internal features of the right atrium:\n \u25cf The posterior internal wall of the right atrium is smooth allowing unconflicted blood flow to enter the right atrium.\n\n \u25cf The anterior internal wall of the right atrium shows numerous parallel muscular ridges called pectinate muscles, these muscles aid with atrial contraction during atrial emptying. Pectinate muscles originate from the crista terminalis which forms the boundary between the posterior smooth wall and the anterior rough wall.\n\n \u25cf The interior of the right atrium exhibits three openings, the SVC opening, the IVC opening, the Coronary sinus opening, and the mitral orifice.\n\n \u25cf The septal wall of the right atrium shows the fossa ovalis, a depression that marks the place of the embryonic foramen ovale. The fossa ovalis lies within the annulus ovalis, a smooth surface surrounding the fossa ovalis that forms a ridge superior to the latter and the ridge shows a recess within it.\n\n - External features of the right ventricle: with its inferior surface resting on the diaphragm, the right ventricle extends from the third costal cartilage to the upper part of the sixth costal cartilage with its anterior surface being smooth and lying in the midline just behind the sternum. The part of the right ventricle from which the pulmonary trunk arises is called the infundibulum, and is slightly thicker than the rest of the ventricle.\n\n - Internal features of the right ventricle: has a rough inflowing part and a smooth outflowing part.\n \u25cf The inflowing part of the right ventricle is rough due to the presence of trabeculae carnea which are irregular muscular projections seen on the surface of the internal wall, they function in holding in the blood with stability. The rough inflowing part also shows three papillary muscles with one arising anteriorly, one arising posteriorly, one is arising from the septal wall and they all project into the vicinity of the right ventricle, these muscles serve as attachment points for the chordae tendinae which are string-like fibrous bands that control the opening and closing of the tricuspid valve of the right ventricle.\n\n \u25cf The smooth outflowing surface has no muscular projections and it leads to the pulmonary valve which corresponds to the infundibulum of the right ventricle externally.\n\n \u25cf The supraventricular crest is a muscular projection that begins at the tricuspid orifice and runs downward forming a concave curve and ending the floor of the ventricle. The supraventricular crest is identified as the border between the rough inflowing and the smooth outflowing part of the right ventricle.\n\n \u25cf The right ventricle also shows the septomarginal trabeculae which is a muscular projection seen at the inferior part between the septal and anterior walls of the right ventricle. It provides coordinated contraction of the anterior papillary muscle and prevents over-distention of the ventricle.\n\n - External features of the left atrium: it extends from the thoracic vertebra T5-T9, posterior to the left atrium lies the esophagus and the descending thoracic aorta. The left atrium shows four openings for the pulmonary veins and the mitral orifice which is guarded by the mitral valve, it also shows the left auricle which is a sharp muscular projection seen just lateral to the pulmonary trunk and at the upper part of the left ventricle.\n\n - Internal features of the left atrium: the walls of the left atrium are smooth and unlike the right atrium they show no muscular ridges, this allows unopposed inflow of blood.\n\n - External features of the left ventricle: the left ventricle is more muscular and thicker than the right ventricle, but is also slightly narrower. The left ventricle rests on the diaphragm thus it forms the majority of the diaphragmatic surface and the most prominent feature of the left ventricle is its apex which gives the heart its conical shape. The apex extends to the left fifth intercostal space at the mid-clavicular line.\n\n - Internal features of the left ventricle:\n \u25cf The internal space of the left ventricle is narrower than that of the right ventricle due to fact that it is more muscular and thicker.\n\n \u25cf Just like the right ventricle the left ventricle has a rough inflowing part and a smooth outflowing part.\n\n \u25cf The inflowing part shows trabeculae carnea but with only two papillary muscles arising from the anterior and posterior wall.\n\n \u25cf The smooth outflowing part lead to the aortic valve where the walls near the aortic valve are made of dense fibrous tissue to withstand the thrust of pressure generated when blood is expelled into the aorta.\n\n - Blood supply of the heart: the blood is supplies by the right and left coronary arteries and their branches. The right coronary artery arises from the right anterior aortic sinus and continues to run along the upper part of the right ventricle along the edge of the auricle of the right atrium then it curves posteriorly to reach the diaphragmatic surface of the heart (giving off branches along its path) and the left coronary artery arises from the left posterior aortic sinus and runs posterior to the pulmonary trunk till it becomes between the latter and the left auricle, here it gives off two branches, one that curves to the diaphragmatic surface of the heart and one that descends along the sternocostal surface of the heart (giving off branches along their path).\n\n - Branches of the right coronary artery:\n \u25cf Right atrial artery: as it arises from the right coronary artery, it runs between the right auricle and ascending aorta and continues posteriorly to the left atrium where it then curves around the superior vena cava to terminate at the right side of the right atrium and gives off a branch to the SA and AV nodes, it supplies the right atrium along with the SA and AV node.\n\n \u25cf Anterior ventricular branches: as it runs along the upper part of the right ventricle, the right coronary artery gives off branches that supply the sternocostal surface of the right ventricle.\n\n \u25cf Right marginal artery: just before it curves to the diaphragmatic surface. The right coronary artery gives off the right marginal artery which supplies the inferior surface of the right ventricle.\n\n \u25cf Posterior interventricular artery: when the right coronary artery reaches the diaphragmatic surface of the heart it gives off the posterior interventricular artery which runs in the posterior interventicular groove, it supplies the diaphragmatic part of the right ventricle, the lower portion of the left ventricle's diaphragmatic portion, the posteroinferior portion of the interventricular septum, it also provides blood supply for the papillary muscles of the right ventricle.\n\n - Branches of the left coronary artery:\n \u25cf Left circumflex artery: is the artery that curves and continues to the diaphragmatic surface of the heart, it supplies the left atrium.\n\n \u25cf Marginal artery: is a branch of the left circumflex artery that arises at the diaphragmatic surface of the left ventricle, it supplies the diaphragmatic surface of the left ventricle and the posterolateral wall of the left ventricle.\n\n \u25cf Anterior interventricular artery: as it arises from the left coronary artery, it descends along the sternocostal surface of the heart in the anterior interventricular groove, it supplies the interventricular septum, the left ventricle, and the papillary muscles of the left ventricle.\n\n \u25cf Diagonal artery: is a lateral branching of the anterior interventricular artery, it runs along the anterolateral surface of the left ventricle (sternocostal surface), it supplies the anterolateral wall of the left ventricle and also contributes to the blood supply of the papillary muscles of the left ventricle.\n\n - Circulation overview: the right atrium receives unoxygenated blood from the IFV, SVC and the coronary sinus. Blood then enters the left ventricle through the tricuspid valve, the ventricle contracts and blood is sent into the pulmonary trunk through the pulmonary valve to the lungs where to gets oxygenated. The pulmonary veins bring the blood back to the left atrium the blood enters the left ventricle through the mitral valve. The left ventricle contracts and ejects the blood into the aorta through the aortic valve to the entire body.\n\n - Impulse transduction in the heart: the SA node located at the top left of the right atrium sets the pace of the heart and is affected by neural stimuli from the sympathetic and parasympathetic fibers. Electrical impulse from the SA node travel via internodal fibers to the AV node located at the floor of the atrium and just superior to the interventricular septum. The AV node is connected to a dense nerve fiber called the bundle of HIS located within the upper portion interventricualr septum, Bundle of HIS then divides into right and left bundle branches. once the bundle branches reach the ventricles they give off numerous nerve fibers called the purkinje fibers that are distributed through out the myocardium of the ventricles.\n\n - Nerve supply of the heart: the heart is controlled by sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves that increase and decrease the heart rate (along with contractility) respectively (see heart physiology of the heart - cardiac electric conduct section).\n\n\"",

      "\"description_cardiovascular_pathologies\" : \"\n Vascular diseases can be inflammatory, thrombotic, or cardiogeneic in origin. This section will hold the discussion on all three types.\n\n - Thrombotic:\n \u25cf Atherosclerosis: is the process of plaque formation in the intima of the arterial blood vessel. It occurs as a result of a pre-existing endothelial tear that exposes the intima of the artery. The LDL and VLDL molecules will enter the intima and as a result macrophages will follow, the macrophages will phagocytize the fat molecules thus becoming foam cells. The foam cells then go through apoptosis and the resultant debris will initiate the process of inflammation where the fat molecules turn into a plaque and the exposed intima accumulates platelets and red blood cells forming a thrombus. This aggregated pact results in thickening of the intima and decreased arterial lumen diameter rendering stenosis and/or aneurysm.\n\n - Hypertension: is increased peripheral resistance causing the heart to pump more vigorously against the increased resistance of the blood vessels. It is divided into three types; primary HTN, secondary HTN, and malignant hypertension.\n\n \u25cf Primary hypertension: is the most common cause of hypertension and is of unknown origin but a number of factors can precipitate this type of hypertension such as sedentary life style, poor diet, old age. Management includes verapamil (in people of african descent) and enalapril (in others).\n\n \u25cf Secondary hypertension: is hypertension that is a consequence of an underlying pathology such as cardiomyopathies and renal artery stenosis. Management is directed towards the underlying cause and targeting the elevated blood pressure with hydrochlorothiazide.\n\n \u25cf Malignant hypertension: is a the sudden and prolonged increase in blood pressure with a reading of 200/120 and above, this condition is a medical emergency and can result in cerebral vessel rupture if not treated promptly, this condition is managed with nitroprusside IV.\n\n - Aortic dissection: is tearing of the aortic tunica intima as a result of long lasting hypertension. The blood flows into the tunica intima causing a severe tearing chest pain that radiates to the back. A feared complication of this condition is cardiac temponade which is collection of blood in the pericardium as result of rupture (temponade present with hypotension, increased jugular venous pressure, and muffled heart sounds). This condition is diagnosed by CT-aortogram is stable and in unstable individuals trans-esophageal echocardiogram is done. Type A aortic dissection occurs in the ascending aorta and the aortic arch and is managed by surgery while type B aortic dissection occurs in the descending aorta and is managed with propranolol IV.\n\n - Thoracic and abdomenal aortic aneurysm: they are ballooning of the aortic see which tunica, as a result of chronic hypertension (thoracic aneurysms are classically seen in tertiary syphilis). Thoracic aneurysms can cause dilation of the aortic root and result in aortic valve regurgitation while abdominal aneurysms can rupture (medical emergency). Thoracic aneurysm presents with a sudden onset of tearing back pain while abdominal aneurysm presents with sudden onset of tearing abdominal pain, thoracic aneurysm is diagnosed by echocardiogram and abdominal aneurysm is diagnosed with CT abdomen and both conditions are managed with surgery.\n\n - Wegener granulomatosis: is necrotizing inflammation of the small vessels of the nasopharynx, lungs, and kidneys associated with granulomatous changes. Clinical presentation is based on the organ involved but generally it includes fever with Sinusitis and nasopharyngeal ulcers with hemoptysis and hematuria along with extra-ocular muscles and CN-VIII involvement. This condition is associated with increased levels of c-ANCA and is diagnosed by obtaining a biopsy sample from the tissue affected and the management of this condition includes prednisone and cyclophosphamide.\n\n - Microscopic polyangitis: is necrotizing inflammation of the small vessels of the lungs and kidneys with no granulomataus changes amd is associated with increased p-ANCA levels. Presents with hemoptysis and hematuria but diagnosis is established by obtaining a biopsy sample from the affected organ and managed with prednisone and cyclophosphamide.\n\n - Chrug-strauss: is necrotizing inflammation of the small vessels of the lungs (asthma is present) and heart (pericardial eosinophilia) characterized by eosinophilic proliferation of the involved organs along with granulomatous changes and systemic eosinophilic proliferation with increased levels of p-ANCA. Presents with fever, sinusitis, nasal polyp, urticaria with vesicles and abdominal pain. This condition is diagnosed by obtaining biopsy sample from the organ involved and management of this condition includes mepolizumab and/or prednisone.\n\n - Polyarteritis nodosa: necrotizing inflammation of the medium vessels supplying the heart, gastrointestinal tract, and kidneys. This condition presents with fever, abdominal pain and hematuria and is diagnosed by obtaining a biopsy sample from the tissue affected. Management of this condition includes prednisone and cyclophosphamide.\n\n - Beurger disease: is necrotizing inflammation of the medium vessels of the fingers and toes that result in gangrene and sloughing of the flesh with amputation of the affected fingers and toes. This condition is diagnosed by angiogram and managed with smoking cessation.\n\n - kawasaki disease: is the non-necrotizing systemic inflammation of medium sized vessels. It occurs mostly in the Pediatric population and presents with fever, unilateral cervical lymphadenopathy (enlargement and tenderness), rash covering the trunk and limbs, bilateral conjunctivitis, desquamation of finger tips and nails, strawberry tongue (glossitits). Blood tests will show marked elevation of CRP and ESR and management includes aspirin and IVIG.\n\n - Giant cell arteritis: is inflammation of the large blood vessels associated with granulomatous changes. Presents with visual disturbances due to involvement of the Opthalamic artery, unilateral headache at the temporal area (temporal artery), and jaw claudication.

Damage to the caudate nucleus results in hyperactivity, lack of motivation, and most significant among all is obsessive-compulsive disorder with the association between the two is yet to be determined.\n\n \u25cf Globus pallidus of lentiform nucleus: functions in conscious properioception and movement, it is divided into the globus pallidus internus which functions as a rely center for information coming in from the striatum and are not processed but the unwanted information/excessive movements are being filtered, the globus pallidus externus receives the information from the globus pallidus internus and sends it to the anterior thalamic nuclei, this process is detailed in the direct and indirect pathways explained later in this section.\n\n - Putamen of the lentiform nucleus: it functions in learning and subconsciously performing learned movement patterns and their power and effectiveness.\n\n - Substantia nigra: functions in sudden rapid eye movements, learning amd planning as well as executing motor movements, the reward system of the brain, and learning. The motor function of the substantia nigra can be appreciated in parkinson's disease where the nucleus losses its dopamine and as a result its significant black color fades thus presenting with the motor disabilities seen in parkinson's disease.\n\n - Direct pathway of the basal ganglia: is a system that processes the planning and execution of a motor movement with several centers being involved as a motor function is being established.\n \u25cf The thalamus being the first center gives rise to glutamate excitatory fibers (first phase of movement execution) that project to the motor centers of the cerebral cortex.\n\n \u25cf The motor centers of the cerebral cortex then send off glutamate excitatory fibers to the striatum.\n\n \u25cf After its stimulation, the striatum sends GABA inhibitory fibers to the globus pallidus internus and the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra.\n\n \u25cf An important concept to this cycle is that both the globus pallidus and the substantia nigra give off inhibitory fibers to the thalamus in order to suppress unwanted movement during execution.\n\n \u25cf The inhibitory fibers from the striatum inhibit the globus pallidus and substantia nigra thus no more inhibitions are applied from the latter on to the thalamus allowing movement to occur.\n\n - Indirect pathway of the basal ganglia: is a system that controls unwanted muscle movement/contraction from causing disturbance to voluntary movements with several centers being involved as movement is being established.\n \u25cf The thalamus being the first center gives rise to glutamate excitatory fibers (first phase of movement execution) that project to the motor centers of the cerebral cortex.\n\n \u25cf The motor centers of the cerebral cortex then send off glutamate excitatory fibers to the striatum.\n\n \u25cf After its stimulation, the striatum sends GABA inhibitory fibers to the globus pallidus externus.\n\n \u25cf an important concepts in this pathway is that naturally, the globus pallidus externus inhibits its following center, the subthalamic nucleus that are activated by the cerebral cortex with their own direct stimulatory fiber from the latter, the subthalamic nucleus functions in stimulating the globus pallidus internus and substantia nigra.\n\n \u25cf now that the globus pallidus externus is inhibited, the subthalamic neuclei may carry on with their action.\n\n \u25cf As its being stimulated by the cerebral cortex, the subthalamic nucleus activates the globus pallidus internus and the substantia nigra pars reticulata.\n\n \u25cf Upon stimulation, the globus pallidus internus and the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra send off GABA inhibitory fibers to the thalamus causing inhibition of unwanted muscle movement/contraction.\n\n\"",

      "\"description_endocrine_pancreas\" : \"\n The endocrine pancreas is concerned with the release of insulin and glucagon in accordance with blood glucose levels where insulin is released in response to high glucose and glucagon is released in response to low glucose levels.\n\n - Synthesis of insulin:\n \u25cf Produced and secreted by the beta-cells of the pancreas located in the islets of langerhans which is a cluster of pancreatic endocrine cells. The insulin is synthesised through a series of intranuclear/intracellular reactions of transcription and translation then resides in the cytoplasm within insulin-containing vesicles waiting to be released.\n\n \u25cf The membrane of the beta-cell houses a glucose channel called GLUT-2 which allows glucose to move in freely into the cell being that it is insulin independent and when glucose levels are high, intuitively more glucose enters the beta cell.\n\n \u25cf In the beta-cell, glucose is metabolised through a series of biochemical reactions (see glucose metabolism; biochemistry section) where its end products are utilized by the mitochondria to form ATP.\n\n \u25cf Since there is more glucose, then more ATP is produced and the high ATP levels work on blocking potassium efflux from the cell by binding to and inactivating the potassium pumps. This results in intracellular potassium accumulation and hyper-depolarization of the cell.\n\n \u25cf This hyper-depolarization effect stimulates the opening calcium channels (voltage gated) and rapid calcium influx occurs. This calcium binds to the synaptophysin protein on the insulin vesicle and to the synaptophysin molecule on the beta-cell membrane thus forming a link between both entities, then insulin is secreted out of the cell and into the blood stream via exocytosis.\n\n - Mechanism of action of insulin:\n \u25cf Liver: the extracellular surface of the liver houses a GLUT-2 glucose channel where glucose freely enters the liver, insulin binds to the extracellular JAK/tryrosin kinase receptor of the liver and upon its activation, a series of intracellualr/intranuclear reactions ensue. The end result of these reactions is to form glycogen (a glucose polymer) from the glucose monomers and to metabolise the glucose via glycolysis.\n\n \u25cf Muscle: the extracellular membrane of skeletal muscles houses GLUT-4 which is an insulin-dependent glucose channel. Insulin binds to its extracellular JAK/tyrosine kinase receptor and upon its activation, a series of intracellular/intranuclear reactions ensue. One result of these reactions is the over regulation of the GLUT-4 channels thus increasing the influx of glucose into the cell and glucose uptake by the muscle where it goes through glycolysis and glycogenesis (primary storage of glucose). Another result of these reactions is the activation and over-regulation of protein channels thereby increasing amino-acid uptake and protein synthesis by the skeletal muscles.\n\n \u25cf Fat tissue: insulin binds to the extracellular JAK/tyrosine kinase protein of the adipose tissue and upon activation, a series of intracellular/intranuclear reactions ensue. Ene result of these reactions is the op-regulation of the GLUT-4 glucose channels of the adipose tissue where more glucose enters the fat cells to become pyruvate via glycolysis or glycerol and fatty acids (that are eventually converted to tri-acyl glycerides) via lipogenesis.\n\n - Glucagon synthesis:\n \u25cf Produced and secreted by the alpha-cells of the pancreas located in the islets of langerhans which is a cluster of pancreatic endocrine cells. The glucagon is synthesised through a series of intranuclear/intracellular reactions of transcription and translation then resides in the cytoplasm within glucagon-containing vesicles waiting to be released.\n\n \u25cf The membrane of the alpha-cells houses a glucose channel GLUT-1 which allows glucose to move in freely into the cell being that it is insulin-independent and when glucose levels are low, intuitively less glucose enters the cell.\n\n \u25cf In the alpha-cell, glucose is metabolised through a series of biochemical reactions where the end products of these reactions are utilized by the mitochondria to from ATP but since there is less glucose influx into the alpha-cells due to low blood glucose levels, hence, less ATP is produced.\n\n \u25cf Due to the low intra-cellular ATP levels the potassium channels are activated since less ATP is bound to those channels, few potassium ions are able to leave the cell but not many and so the cell still manages to maintain intracellular depolarization.\n\n \u25cf Once depolarization occurs, calcium channels (voltage gated) open and calcium influx starts. The calcium binds to the synaptophysin protein molecule on the glucagon-containing vesicle and also binds to the synaptophysin protein molecule of the cell membrane forming a link, then glucagon is secreted via exocytosis into the blood.\n\n - Mechanism of action of glucagon:\n \u25cf Liver: glucagon binds to extracellular the G-protein coupled receptors and via the adenylyl cyclase pathway it exerts in function which includes glycogenolysis (glucose polymer) and converting it to glucose monomers. Also one of the functions of glucagon is gluconeogenesis which the formation of glucose from glycerol, amino-acids, and lactate. This in turn increases blood glucose levels back to normal.\n\n \u25cf Fat tissue: glucagon binds to the extracellular G-protein coupled receptors of the adipose cells and via the adenylyl cyclase pathway it exerts it function by activating the enzyme hormone sensitive lipase which cleaves tri-acyl glycerides into glycerol and fatty acids, a process called lipolysis.\n\n\"",

      "\"description_degenerative_pathologies\" : \"\n Degenerative disorders are those of sudden or gradual onset that are characterized by progressive deterioration of the central nervous system and its functions.\n\n - Pick disease: is a condition affecting the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain where the tau proteins lose their integrity and begin to fuse with one another giving a characteristic appearance under the microscope known as pick bodies. This aggregation of tau proteins in the neurons results in the progressive loss of functionality of the lobes affected thus presenting with cognitive decline, behavioral changes and progressive aphasia. This condition is diagnosed clinically and with MRI (shrinkage of the lobs) and biopsy (showing pick bodies), currently has no treatment.\n\n - Huntington disease: is an inherited condition of autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance characterized by expansion of the tri-nucleotide repeat sequence C-A-G on chromosome 4 which results in the degradation of the GABA stimulated neurons of the caudate nucleus in the basal ganglia rendering the latter atrophy. This condition presents with a characteristic chorea which is a form of gross involuntary movements and deteriorated cognition. This condition is diagnosed with MRI (atrophy of the basal ganglia and shrinkage of the cortex with widened sulci and ventricles) and genetic study for the expansion of the tri-nucleotide repeat sequence C-A-G, no current medication is available to slow this condition's progression but sertralin is used to manage depression and tetrabenzaine is used to manage chorea.\n\n - Parkinson's disease: a condition of progressive deterioration characterized by degradation of the dopamin stimulated neurons and the nigrostriatal dopaminergic (indirect) pathway of the substantia nigra causing the latter to lose its characteristic dark appearance and the accumulation of alpha-synuclein in the neurons. This condition presents with characteristic pill-rolling tremor at rest, cogwheel rigidity (involuntary jerks when stretching of muscles), bradykinesia, masked facies (expressionless face), dysarthria, unstable stance with shuffling gait and stooped posture. This condition is treated with levidopa/carbidopa and amantadine.\n\n - Alzheimer disease: is a form of dementia characterized by global degeneration of the cerebral cortex due to the fusion of beta-amyloid plaques between neurons that eventually pack the neurons with one another to form neurofibirillary tangles which are basically amyloid-aggregated nerve fibers mixed with hyperphosphorylated tau proteins. This condition presents with progressive memory and cognitive decline, impaired recognition of familiar objects or individuals, inability to perform planned motor actions, loss of coherent speech and apathy. This condition is diagnosed by MRI (atrophy of the cerebral gyri, widening of the sulci and ventricles) but gold-standard is viewing of the cerebral changes on autopsy. This condition has no current treatment to slow its progression but rivastigmine, galantamine, and donepizil are given for symptomatic relief.\n\n - Lewy bodies dementia: is a progressive condition similar to alzheimer disease but is different in that it is associated with characteristic visual hallucinations and rapid deterioration of cognition in comparison to alzheimer disease. This condition is diagnosed clinically but the definitive diagnosis is done by brain autopsy which shows the tau protein aggregates (also called acidophillic intra-cytoplasmic inclusion proteins) in the neurons of the cortex and sub-cortical regions of the brain. No current treatment can slow the progression of this condition but rivastagmine, galantamine, and donepizil are given for symptomatic relief.\n\n - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: is a degenerative condition affecting the skeletal muscles by primarily degrading the motor neurons of the anterior horn of the spinal cord (resulting in lower motor neuron lesions/symptoms) and those of the primary motor cortex (resulting in upper motor neuron lesions/symptoms). It presents with fasciculations of skeletal muscles including the tongue, weakness of the upper and lower limbs which can start with spasticity of skeletal muscles and deep tendon hyper-reflexia (upper motor symptom) or flaccidity of skeletal muscles and deep tendon hypo-reflexia (it can progress from one form to another), can start with spastic paralysis or flaccid paralysis and progress from one form to another, difficulty swallowing (dysphagia), difficulty speaking (dysarthria), and difficulty breathing (phrenic nerve nuclei degeneration i.e flaccid paralysis of the diaphragm).

This part of the duodenum receives the hepatoduodenal ligament which constitutes part of the lesser omentum along with the hepatogastric ligament and is draped by peritoneum only at its beginning.\n\n \u25cf The descending part of the duodenum: it begins at the superior duodenal flexure and levels with the L2 vertebra. This part is special as it possess the major and minor duodenal papillae, the major duodenal papilla is a mucousal projection housing the pacreatic and common bile ducts as they open into the duodenum and the minor duodenal papilla is also a mucousal projection but it carries within it the accessory pancreatic duct. The descending part ends at the inferior duodenal flexure where it then continues as the inferior part of the duodenum.\n\n \u25cf The inferior part of the duodenum: it crosses back to the left side and levels with L3 vertebra. this part crosses anterior to the inferior vena cava and abdominal aorta to the left side, but also it is being crossed anteriorly by the descending superior mesenteric artery and vein.

In contrary to the ileum, the jejunum shows a bigger diameter, has lesser lymphoid aggregates than the ileum, has fewer arcades (arterial branches of the superior meseneteric artery seen in the mesentery of the small intestine), and less (in numbers) but long vasa recta (straight arterial branches arising from the arcades and run through the mesentry to supply the jejunum). The jejunum is supplied by the superior mesenteric artery (branch of the abdominal aorta) and is an intraperitoneal organ.\n\n - The lieum: lies at the hypogastric region and a minor part of the left iliac region. it differs from the jujenum in having a smaller diameter, more lymphoid aggregates (peyer's patches), numerous arcades, and short vasa recta. The ileum ends at the left part of the abdomen by opening into the cecum of the colon through the ileocecal valve. The ileum is supplied by the superior mesenteric artery and is an intraperitoneal organ.\n\n - The small intestine receives parasympathetic innervation from the vagus nerve and sympathetic innervation from the thoracic splanchnic nerves.\n\n - Musculature of the small intestine: unlike the stomach the small intestine has an outer longitudinal muscle layer and an inner circular muscle layer. the longitudinal muscles shorten the length the small intestine upon contraction and as this takes place the circular muscles will also simultaneously contract decreasing the diameter of the small intestine, this process propels contents of the small intestine further (peristalsis).\n\n\"",
      "\"description_patho_platelets\" : \"\n - Thrombocytopenia: is a condition characterized by low platelet levels (normal range 150000-450000 per micro Liter) leading to increased susceptibility of bleeding and increased frequency of bruising. It results from malignant proliferation of one of the blood cell lineages (overcrowding effect), autoimmune disorders that affect platelet function, or post-viral status. The tendency of bleeding depends on the level of platelets, at 100000 or below bleeding is unlikely, below 50000 bleeding occurs upon minor trauma and following surgery, at 20000 bleeding occurs spontaneously with frequent bruising, gum bleeds, and epistaxis, below 5000 is life threatening and results in spontaneous internal bleeding. This condition is diagnosed by blood tests for CBC and managed with platelet transfusion.\n\n - Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura: is a condition characterized by impaired function or the lack of ADAMTS13 (responsible for the cleavage of von-Willbrand factor) which results in von-Willbrand multimers, this leads to the formation of a micro-thrombus that consumes platelets as it grows thus forming a large thrombus that is able to occlude blood vessels, such an event would lead to ischemia and rupture of RBCs. It presents with fever, bruising, petechea, signs and symptoms similar to iron deficiency and hemolytic anemia, and central nervous system manifestations. This condition is diagnosed by blood tests for CBC, iron profile, LDH, Haptoglobin, Reticulocyte count, normal PT, normal PTT, normal Fibrinogen, and peripheral blood smear which shows schistocytes. Management of this condition includes plasmapheresis, IV prednisolone, cyclosporin-A/rituximab.\n\n - Immune thrombocytopenic purpura: is a condition characterized by an autoimmune reaction following a viral infection or an underlying autoimmune disease where IgG immunoglobulins bind to the platelets promoting their destruction by the spleen. It presents with increased bleeding tendencies such as bruising, petechea, gum bleeds, epistaxis, and menorrhagia. This condition is diagnosed by blood tests for CBC, anti-platelet antibody, and peripheral blood smear. Management of this condition includes prednisone, IVIG, rituximab (all three are indicated for acute onset) and eltrombopag (indicated for chronic conditions).\n\n - Essential thrombocythemia: is a condition characterized by the malignant proliferation of platelets in the bone marrow as a result of a sporadic genetic mutation of the JAK-2 gene.

This condition is diagnosed by blood tests for CBC, genetic analysis for JAK-2 mutation, and bone marrow biopsy showing high level platelets and large megakaryocytes. Management of this condition includes hydroxyurea and busulfan/hydroxycarbamide.\n\n - Bernard soulier syndrome: is a condition of autosomal recessive inheritance pattern (recognized at birth) characterized by low platelet levels and failure of the platelets to adhere to the sub-endothelium in order to form a clot due to a genetic mutation and deletion of chromosome 22 segments resulting in an impaired and deficient glycoprotein-1b-9 (surface protein anchors platelets to the sub-endothelium). It presents with signs and symptoms similar to those of thrombocytopenia. This condition is diagnosed by blood tests for CBC, increased bleeding time (2-9 minutes), flow cytometry, failure of ristocetin-induced platelet adherence, and peripheral blood smear showing large platelets.\n\n - Glanzmann thrombosthenia: is a condition of autosomal recessive inheritance pattern (recognized at birth) characterized by normal platelet levels yet failure of the platelets to adhere with one another to form a clot due to a genetic mutation and deletion on chromosome 17 resulting in an impaired and deficient glycoprotein-2A/3B (surface protein anchors platelets to one another). It presents with signs and symptoms similar to those of thrombocytopenia. This condition is diagnosed by increased bleeding time, flow cytometry, and light transmission aggregometry. Management of this condition includes activated recombinant factor-7A.\n\n\"",

This condition presents with decreased urine output and fluid retention (notices by peripheral and peri-orbital edema) along with urea accumulation.\n\n - Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis: is a condition characterized by inflammation of the glomeruli following group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis (glomeruli affected two to three weeks after the bout of pharyngitis). The inflammation results in immune complex deposition in the glomerular basement membrane that are shown to have a glomerular appearance under immunofluorescence. This condition is diagnosed by blood test for antistreptolysin and antihyaluronidase titer, culture sample obtained from skin and throat, immunofluorescence assay and kidney biopsy showing subepithelial humps under the electron microscope. Management of this condition includes benzathine penicillin G and furosemide.\n\n - Alport syndrome: is a type of Nephritic syndrome characterized by genetic mutations in genes encoding type four collagen, a condition of the X-linked inheritance pattern. This defect results in a disrupted glomerular basement membrane and its associated blood vessels (thinning and increased fragility) leading to hematuria, it also presents with corneal opacity, sensory hearing loss, and anterior lenticonus (anterior protrusion of the central part of the lens).

Urine passes through the ureter via peristalsis and does not flow passively.\n\n - The ureters show three evident constrictions along their course:\n \u25cf The first stricture seen at the pelvico-ureteric junction.\n\n \u25cf The second stricture seen at the point where the ureter crosses over the common iliac vessels.\n\n \u25cf The third stricture seen at the level of the vesico-ureteric junction.\n\n \u2713 These constrictions are significant for they are the most common site for renal stone impaction.\n\n - Blood supply of the ureter:\n \u25cf Superior part of the ureter is supplied by the renal artery.\n\n \u25cf The middle part of the ureter receives blood supply from the gonadal arteries and the common iliac arteries.\n\n \u25cf The lower part (pelvic part) of the ureter receives blood supply from the internal iliac artery.\n\n - The urinary bladder: is a hollow muscular sac that lies in the pelvis just posterior to the pubic symphysis and anterior to the rectum (in males) or the uterus (in females).\n\n - The internal part of the urinary bladder: shows multiple rugae which provides more surface area for the urinary bladder to expand when it is filled with urine, this expansion is also aided by the transitional epithelium that lines the urinary bladder. As the urinary bladder fills, the transitional epithelium transitions from its squamous cell-like appearance to its columnar cell-like appearance providing more surface area for the bladder's expansion.\n\n - The trigon: is a smooth triangular area seen internally at the base of the bladder with the upper tip pointing anteriorly towards the internal urethral orifice and its two lateral tips pointing towards the ureteric openings.\n\n \u2713 The urinary bladder could hold 500ml of urine but the urge to urinate arises when the level of urine reaches approximately 350ml and at 500ml urination happens. The detrusor muscle plays a critical role in emptying the urinary bladder and maintaining the urine within the bladder.\n\n - The detrusor muscle: is a smooth muscle that originally is at its resting phase while the bladder is being filled with urine and contracts when it is time to emtpy the bladder. The detrosur muscle originates from the dorso-medial surface of the pubic bone and runs in multiple directions posteriorly in the pelvis to give the urinarry bladder its shape then terminates into the upper surface of the prostate in males oer the upper and anterior surfaces of the vagina in females. It receives blood supply from the same arteries supplying the bladder which will be mentioned shortly. The internal urinary sphincters prevent dripping of urine through the urethra and are involuntarily controlled by the autonomic nervous system.\n\n \u2713 The urinary bladder is resting directly over the deep perineal pouch in females but in males it is resting over the prostate which it self is resting on the deep perineal pouch.\n\n - Ligaments of the urinary bladder:\n \u25cf Median umbilical ligament: is a single ligament that originates from the upper surface of the of the urinary bladder and ascends in the midline to terminate into the umbilicus.

It is a remnant of the umbilical artery that obliterates after birth and is covered by a peritoneal fold along its path called the medial umbilical fold.\n\n \u25cf Lateral ligament: originates from the infero-lateral surface of the urinary bladder and runs laterally in a horizontal fashion through the pelvic cavity where it then would terminate into the tendinous arch of the pelvic fascia.\n\n \u25cf Posterior ligament: arises from the postero-lateral surface of the bladder and runs postero-laterally through the posterior pelvic cavity in a horizontal fashion to terminate into the postero-lateral part of the tendinous arch of the perineal fascia.\n\n \u25cf Medial pubo-prostatic ligament: extends from the infero-medial surface of the bladder (neck of the bladder) just above the prostate gland and extends anteriorly through the pelvic cavity to terminate into the medial part of the dorsal surface of the pubic bone.\n\n \u25cf Lateral pubo-cervical ligament: is a broad band-like ligament that extends from the infero-lateral surface of bladder (neck of the bladder) just above the prostate and extends anteriorly where it terminates into the lateral part of the dorsal surface of the pubic bone just lateral to the insertion of the medial pubo-cervical ligament.\n\n - Blood supply of the urinary bladder:\n \u25cf Superior vesical artery: arises from the umbilical artery which is a branch of the internal iliac artery and runs through the pelvis to reach the upper surface of the bladder where it gives off a number of branches to supply the superior part of the urinary bladder and the ductus deferens.\n\n \u25cf Middle vesical artery: is a branch of the superior vesical artery that descends to the reach the inferior part of the bladder which it supplies along with the seminal vesical.\n\n \u25cf Inferior vesical/vaginal artery: arises from the anterior trunk of the internal iliac artery. It descends into the pelvis to reach the inferior surface of the urinary bladder which it supplies along with the prostate. In females this artery is called the vaginal artery.\n\n - Parts of the urethra:\n \u25cf Prostatic urethra: is the first part of the urethra and at its beginning lies the internal urethral sphincters. The prostatic urethra shows multiple features, the numerous glandular prostatic openings, the longitudinal fold that are seen in the midline at the upper and lower parts of the prostatic urethra (urethral crest), the bulge seen between the upper and lower urethral crest (seminal colliculus), the small rounded blind-hole that is seen on the center of the seminal colliculus (prostatic utericle) and the two openings of the seminal vesicles seen on either side lateral to the prostatic utricle.\n\n \u25cf Membranous urethra: is the narrowest and shortest part of the urethra, at its beginning and just below the prostate it is surrounded by the external urethral sphincter which made out of skeletal muscles hence it is voluntarily controlled. The bulbo-urethral glands open into the dented part of the membranous urethra, this gland release a lubricating substance providing a smooth passage for semen.\n\n \u25cf Spongy urethra: is the longest portion of the urethra and extends from the dented part of the membranous urethra to the external urethral orifice, it is surrounded by the corpus spongiosum of the penis. Just before the external urethral orifice the spongy urethra forms a dilatation called the navicular fossa.\n\n - Blood supply of the urethra:\n \u25cf Prostatic urethra: receives blood supply from the inferior vesical artery.\n\n \u25cf Membranous urethra: receives blood supply from the bulbo-urethral artery.\n\n \u25cf Spongy urethra: receives blood supply from the internal pudendal artery.\n\n\"",

      "\"description_organ_circulation\" : \"\n Blood distribution to organs of the body varies according to the demand of that specific organs and the fluctuation in blood volume is brought upon by either metabolite levels or sympathetic control.\n\n - Skin: blood to the skin modulates body temperature and since the vessels of the skin are innervated by the sympathetic system it provides a faster reaction to changes. When the inner body temperature increase, the sympathetic action decreases and skin vessels dilate thereby shifting the blood with high temperature to the skin and heat is lost to the surroundings but when the inner body temperature decreases the sympathetic system causes the skin vessels to contract and preventing blood from shifting to the skin thereby conserving heat.\n\n - Skeletal muscles: the blood flow to skeletal muscles is regulated by both metabolites and the sympathetic system. During rest, the muscle isn't producing metabolites nor is it in need of more blood volume so the sympathetic system acts upon the alpha-1 receptors to cause constriction of the vessels and so blood is utilized elsewhere. During exercise, the sympathetic system activates beta-2 receptors and causes dilation of the vessels and since the muscle is active there are metabolites being produced (and need to be washed out), this increases the blood flow to the muscles. The metabolite system is dominant during exercise because potent vasodilating metabolites are being produced such as Lactate, CO2, and Adenosine.\n\n - Heart: blood flow to the heart is regulated by the metabolite system which is highly sensitive to low levels of oxygen. When oxygen levels decline due to failed ventilation-perfusion or increased heart rate, this put more demand of oxygen to the heart and so the coronary arteries vasodilate to increase the blood volume directed to the heart to meet its requirements.\n\n - Lungs: blood regulation to the lungs is carried out by the metabolite system where O2 is the prime modulator. With other organ, low levels of oxygen result in vasodilation but with the lungs it results in vasoconstriction as when an area of the lungs lacks ventilation the blood vessels of the that area contract and redirect/shunting blood to areas with better ventilation.\n\n - Brain: blood regulation through the brain is carried out via the metabolite system where an increase in the levels of CO2 and PH causes blood vessels to dilate this results in an increase of blood volume being delivered to the brain.\n\n \u2713 Blood regulation is achieved through three mechanism, reactive hyperemia, active hyperemia, and auto-regulation.\n\n - Reactive hyperemia: is when the blood volume to an organ increase as a result of a preceding occlusion and the amount and speed of the amount of blood delivered correlates with the time allocated of the occlusion (the longer the occlusion, the faster and more blood flows to that area).\n\n - Active hyperemia: is the increase in blood volume delivered to a tissue based on its activity and metabolite production where more activity results in more metabolite production thus increasing blood flow.\n\n - Auto regulation: is when an organ maintains constant blood flow despite changes in blood pressure or occlusion of a certain vessel. With occlusion of a vessel other arteries would dilate to maintain a constant blood delivery and with low blood pressure vessels dilate inorder to maintain a constant blood supply.\n\n\"",

One sacromere unit consists of two vertical Z-lines lying in parallel with one another, multiple thin fibers called actin, between every actin lies a thick fiber called myosin, and in the middle of the sarcomere unit lies the M-line which signifies the median part of the sarcomere.\n\n The two vertical Z-lines are located at a distance away from each other but the fibers arising from reach out to one another, the thin actin fibers are anchored to the Z-line by a structure called the Cap-Z and run horizontally towards the M-line but don't reach it, the thick myosin fibers arise from the z line via a string-like structure called titine, the fibers thicken and run horizontally towards the M-line and connect to the thick fibers of the opposite Z-line via their myosin tail.\n\n The area at which the actin fibers do not overlap the myosin fibers (the beginning of their origination) is called the I-band, the area where the actin and myosin fibers overlap is called the A-band, and the distance between the thin fibers in the median area of the sacromere is called the H-zone.\n\n \u2713 The cell membrane of the skeletal muscles (also called he sarcolema) contains deep trench-like structures called T-tubules which store large amounts of calcium (outside the cell), when action potential travels along the cell membrane and into the T-tubules it stimulates the opening of the calcium channels causing a calcium influx into the cell membrane. Moreover, within the cell membrane lies the sarcoplasmic reticulum which also contains calcium and as calcium moves into the cell from the T-tubules, it also stimulates the sarcoplasmic reticulum to release its own calcium into the cell and to further enhance contraction.\n\n - Troponin and tropomyosin:\n \u25cf Troponin-I: functions in inhibiting the binding sites on actin fibers preventing cross bridging between actin and myosin thereby inhibiting contraction.\n\n \u25cf Troponin-C: functions in binding calcium and moving troponin-I from the actin binding site to initiate contraction.\n\n \u25cf Troponin-T: functions in anchoring tropomyosin on to actin providing more stability for tropomyosin on actin.\n\n \u25cf Tropomyosin: is a thin filament that covers the myosin binding sites on actin to prevent cross bridging and contraction. It is aided into its position by troponin-T and troponin-I but is moved from its position by binding of calcium on to troponin-C.\n\n - Actin-myosin interaction:\n 1: Calcium binds to troponin-C and displaces troponin-I, T, and tropomyosin from the myosin binding sites on actin.\n\n 2: Now that the binding sites on actin are free, myosin still can't bind since it has an ADP and a Pi (phosphate) molecule attached to it.\n\n 3: The myosin has to free the phosphate molecule since the latter acts as a stabilizer and preventing movement of the myosin.\n\n 4: Myosin releases the Pi molecule and attaches to its binding site on actin, it uses the power generated by the ADP to propel the actin forward (this is the contraction).\n\n 5: After using the ADP, now myosin has no energy molecules and so ATP binds to and releases myosin from the its binding site on the actin fiber.\n\n 6: The enzyme myosin ATPase converts the ATP attached to myosin into an ADP molecule and Pi molecule thus stabilizing the myosin.\n\n 7: Now that the first actin has been propelled forward, myosin releases its Pi and binds to the second actin.\n\n\"",
      "\"description_nerves_upper_limb\" : \"\n The nerve supply of the upper limb is divided into sensory and motor supply but all nerves serving the upper extremities rise from the brachial plexus.\n\n The brachial plexus is a bundle of nerve fibers originating from the anterior spinal branches of the C5-T1 and here we will be describing each spinal root, its trunk, divisions, cords, and terminal branches.\n\n \u2713 The trunks of the brachial plexus are identified as superior, posterior, and inferior in relation to the anterior scalene muscle. Then those trunks divide and collectively give off six divisions (three anterior and three posterior, identified as such according to their relation with the first part of the axillary artery) and the divisions continue to form cords (lateral, posterior, medial, and are identified as such according to their relation with the second part of the axillary artery). The three cords then divide into giving off the terminal nerve branches which are the main four nerves of the upper limb (musculocutaneous, median, radial and ulnar nerves).\n\n - Anterior branch of C5:\n \u25cf Root: three branches are seen to be given off by the root of C5, the long thoracic nerve (descends and receives branches from C6 and C7 i.e it is referred to the C5, C6, C7 spinal roots), a branch that unites with C3 and C4 to supply the diaphragm, and the dorsal scapular nerve (supplies the rhomboids and levator scapulae muscles).

Four nerves arise from the posterior cord, the axillary nerve (arising from the suoerficial surface, supplies the tricpes, teres minor, and deltoid muscles along with the skin overlying the deltoid), superior subscapular nerve (arises from the inferior surface, supplies the superior portion of the subscapularis), thoracodorsal nerve (arises from the inferior surface, supplies latissimus dorsi), and the inferior subscapular nerve (arises from the inferior surface, supplies the inferior portion of the subscapularis).\n\n \u25cf Terminal branches: the cord then continues to from the terminal branch of C7, the radial nerve which will be explained later in this section.\n\n - Anterior branch of C8:\n \u25cf root: the root of C8 shows no branches at its verge but unites with the root of C8 to form the inferior trunk of the brachial plexus.\n\n \u25cf Division: the inferior trunk divides into anterior and posterior (ascends to unite with the posterior division of C7).\n\n \u25cf Cord: the anterior division continues to give the medial cord of the brachial plexus. This cord gives off three nerve branches all arising from its inferior surface, the medial pectoral nerve (supplies the pectoralis muscles primarily the minus), medial cutaneous nerve of the arm (supplies the medial skin of the arm), and the medial cutaneous nerve of the forearm (supplies the medial skin of the forearm).\n\n \u25cf Terminal branches: the medial cord divides into two terminal branches, a branch that ascends and unites with the inferior terminal branch of the lateral cord to from the median nerve and a single branch that forms the ulnar nerve.\n\n - Anterior branch of T1:\n \u25cf root: at its verge, gives off no branches but ascends to unite with C8 to from the inferior trunk of the brachial plexus. Then it continues as describes in C8.\n\n - Musculocutaneous nerve: arises from C5-C7, it provides both motor and sensory supply to the upper limb. it provides motor innervation to the muscles of the anterior compartment of the arm and provides sensory innervation to the lateral skin of the forearm.\n\n - Median nerve: as it arises from C5-C6 and C8-T1, it provides motor and sensory innervation to the forearm and hand. It provides motor innervation to the muscles of the anterior compartment of the forearm (except those supplies by the ulnar nerve) and the thenar muscles of the hand along with the lateral two lumbricals. It provides sensory innervation skin over the thumb, index, middle, and lateral half of ring finger along with the corresponding skin of the palms.\n\n - Ulnar nerve: it provides motor and sensory supply to the forearm and hand, provides motor innervation to the medial portion of the flexor digitorum profundus and the flexor carpi ulnaris muscles of the forearm and it provides sensory innervation to the skin over the medial half of the ring finger and small finger and their dorsal skin surface (with the corresponding dorsal surface of the hand) along with the corresponding skin e palms.\n\n - Radial nerve: as it originates from the roots of C5-T1, it provides motor and sensory innervation to the arm, forearm, and hand.

      "\"description_liver_patho\" : \"\n - Fatty liver disease: is a condition characterized by hepatic insult due to intra/extra hepatic fat accumulation, it occurs with individuals who are morbidly obese or those with dyslipidemia. This condition presents with right upper quadrant pain and is diagnosed by blood test showing markedly high lipid profile and liver enzymes but the gold-standard diagnostic test is biopsy which shows expanded (glycogen filled) hepatocytes, glycogenated nuclei, and macro-vesicular steatosis but it is often discovered as an incidental finding on abdominal ultrasound. Management of this condition includes gradual weight loss, vitamin E, and management of the underlying dyslipidemia or diabetes. \n\n - Alcoholic liver disease: is a condition characterized by hepatic insult via the alcohol metabolite acetaldehyde due to chronic alcohol consumption. It presents with right upper quadrant pain and is diagnosed by blood test showing deranged liver enzymes and lipid profile but the gold-standard diagnostic test is biopsy showing neutrophil parenchymal infiltration and mallory bodies. Management of this condition includes alcohol cessation and methylprednisolone. \n\n - Acute liver failure: is a condition characterized by rapid deterioration of hepatic function as a result of an infection, medication (particularly paracetamol toxicity), or hepatic ischemia due to hypoperfusion. It presents with gross ecchymosis (coagulopathy) hepatic encephalitis (due to ammonia accumulation), jaundice, and ascites. This condition is diagnosed by increased prothrombin time, ALT, and albumin.\n\n - Wilson disease: is a congenital disorder of autosomal recessive inheritance characterized by impairment of copper metabolism due a genetic mutation in the ATP7B gene which is responsible for encoding copper transport proteins. This results in failed copper excretion in bile thus it accumulates in the tissues. It presents with jaundice and hyperpigmentation of the skin, kayser-fleischer rings of the eyes, hemolytic anemia, and flapping tremors. This condition is diagnosed by blood test for decreased ceruloplasmin, urine analysis for copper, and the gold-standard liver biopsy showing copper accumulation via lipofuscin stain, glycogenated nuclei, and mallory bodies. Management of this condition includes penicellamine for copper chelation and zinc to decrease copper absorption.\n\n - Hemochromatosis: is a condition characterized by iron overload being either genetic (autosomal recessive) or caused by blood transfusion resulting in excessive iron deposition in the tissues. It presents with bronze discoloration of the skin, arthralgia, heart failure (dilated cardiomyopathy), diabetes (pancreatic insufficiency), and impotence. This condition is diagnosed by blood test showing a deranged iron profile with markedly increased ferritin levels, genetic testing for HEF gene, and liver biopsy showing bronze discoloration of hepatocytes.\n\n - Hepatic Hemangioma: is a blood-containing well circumscribed bening tumor of the liver that is encapsulated by epithelial. These tumors are of unknown etiology but prolonged use of oral contraceptives (increased estrogen levels) have been linked to its formation. This condition is mostly asymptomatic and discovered accidentally on imaging. Hemangiomas are removed if they are symptomatic or increase in size but if they are asymptomatic then observation is the chosen approach.\n\n \u2713 ALT is the most liver-specific enzyme thus is used as an indicator of hepatic injury. When ALT levels are between 100-500 it indicates a chronic inflammation or alcoholic liver disease, when ALT levels are 500-5000 it is indicative of acute liver injury and hepatitis, and when ALT levels are above 5000 it is due to paracetamol toxicity, hepatic infarct/ischemia, or cirrhosis.\n\n\"",

      "\"description_anatomy_thyroid_gland\" : \"\n In this section we will be discussing the position, blood supply and innervation of the thyroid gland but as for its function see endocrine physiology - thyroid gland hormones section.\n\n The thyroid gland is located deep to neck muscles just below the cricoid cartilage and is attached to it by the suspensory ligament of the thyroid galnd. The thyroid gland has two lobes and the isthmus, the two lobes are pyramidal in shape and lie lateral to the trachea where the upper pole of the lobe extends upward to reach the lateral part of the thyroid cartilage and the isthmus which also a glandular tissue serves as a connection between the two lateral lobes as it is located in the center anterior to the trachea.\n\n It is important to note that the thyroid gland is enclosed by an outer and inner layer of a fibrous capsule, false and true capsule respectively. The false capsule is just a cover of fibrous tissue extending onto the thyroid gland from the pretracheal fascia (a sheet of connective tissue that lines the trachea) and beneath the false capsule lies the true capsule which has its fibers invested into the substance of the thyroid gland, these fibers divide the thyroid gland into lobules that are further divide into follicles which are the functional unit of the gland.\n\n - Blood supply of the thyroid gland:\n \u25cf Superior thyroid artery: as it originates from the external carotid artery at the level of the upper lateral border of the thyroid cartilage it descends to supply the upper pole of the lateral poles, as it reaches the apex of the upper pole it divides into anterior and posterior glandular arteries that supply the anterior and posterior surfaces of the upper poles. These branching arteries also provide blood supply to the isthmus as the anterior glandular artery connects with it pair at the isthmus.\n\n \u25cf Inferior thyroid artery: as it arises from the thyrocervical trunk (a branch of the subclavian artery) it ascends and runs medially behind the external carotid artery to reach the inferior pole of the lateral lobe, as it reaches the inferior pole it gives off two branches, a branch that supplies the posteroinferior surface of the lateral lobe (and connects with the posterior glandular artery) and a branch that supplies the parathyroid glands.\n\n \u2713 Thyroid ima artery: is a small artery that arises from the brachiocephalic trunk and ascends in the median plane to terminate into the isthmus, a structure that it supplies.\n\n \u2713 The thyroid gland receives sympathetic innervation from the superior, middle and inferior ganglion, it also receives parasympathetic innervation from the superior and recurrent laryngeal nerves. The thyroid gland operates via hormonal mechanisms not nerve supply.\n\n\"",
      "\"description_of_ascending_spinal_tracts\" : \"\n Nerve fibers in the spinal cord are arranged as ascending and descending tracts where ascending tracts are concerned with afferent sensory information that can be divided into exteroceptive (from outside the body like touch pain and temperature) and proprioceptive (from muscles and joints) information that is transmitted via a third neuron chain.\n\n - Ascending signal transmission sequence in spinal tracts:\n \u25cf An impulse travels from the receptor to the first order neuron whose cell body is located in the posterior root ganglion of the spinal nerve, a process enters the spinal cord through the posterior root ganglion to synapse with the second order neuron that lies in the spinal cord.\n\n \u25cf The second order neuron gives rise to an axon that crosses to the opposite side of the spinal cord and ascends to higher centers in the CNS where it synapses with the third motor neuron in the thalamus.\n\n \u25cf The third neuron then would give projection fibers that travels to a sensory region in the cortex.\n\n\"",

      "\"description_sleep_resp_patho\" : \"\n Respiratory sleeping disorders can be categorized into obstructive and central sleep apnea where obstructive sleep apnea occurs due to weak patency of the upper respiratory tract and central sleep apnea is mediated by the respiratory centers of the brain.\n\n - Obstructive sleep apnea: known to occur with obese individuals, it results from relaxation of the muscles of the tongue (genioglossus and palatoglossus), soft palate (tensor palatini, levator Levi palatini, and palatopharyngeus), constrictor pharyngeal muscles, and muscles of the upper airway (geniohyoid, mylohyoid, sternohyoid, thyrohyoid). In obesity, the muscle's activity is decreased and they tend to collapse thus causing the obstruction, in addition to the increased fat collection around the neck which aids to the obstructive apnea by further narrowing of the airway.\n\n - Central apnea: is when breathing is disrupted for a continuous 10 second period during sleep due to underlying disturbances affecting the respiratory centers of the brain.\n\n - Types of central sleep apnea:\n \u25cf Cheyne-stokes breathing: is an abnormal breathing patters characterized by an episode of hyperventilation followed by an episode of hypoventilation and shallow breathing as these cyclic changes continue for approximately one or two minutes until they are interrupted by apnea. This condition occurs in patients with stroke and heart failure due to the accumulated carbondioxide that triggers the hyperventilation.\n\n \u25cf Opioid-driven central apnea: chronic use of opiates causes central sleep apnea since they result in respiratory depression by acting on the mu-opioid receptor of the respiratory centers in the brainstem, the breathing pattern here is gradual hypoventilation until cessation of breath.\n\n \u25cf Altitude-driven central apnea: occurs in altitudes above 5Km as high altitudes exhibit less oxygen levels than sea-level thus individuals would develop hypercarbia, this results in hyperventilation followed by hypocarbia. The hypocarbia is what results in central sleep apnea.\n\n \u2713 Obstructive and central sleep apnea are diagnosed by sleep study and are managed by treatment directed towards the underlying cause however mainstay therapy remains CPAP.\n\n\"",

It presents with blindness of the lateral visual fields of both eyes with sparring of the medial visual fields.\n\n \u25cf Crossed homonymous hemianopia: is of two types, one is caused by aneurysm of the internal carotid artery which applies pressure over the optic tract and present with blindness of the medial (nasal) blindness in the visual field of the left eye and lateral (temporal) blindness in the visual field of the right eye. The second type of homonymous hemianopia occurs due to total damage of the optic radiation in the occipital lobe and has same clinical presentation of the first one.\n\n \u25cf Crossed homonymous hemianopia with macular sparring: results from ischemia involving the posterior cerebral artery where the optic radiations in the temporal and occipital lobes are damaged, it presents with medial blindness in the visual field left and lateral blindness in the visual field of the right eye with sparring of the central visual fields.\n\n \u25cf Medial (nasal) hemianopia: results from internal carotid artery aneurysm which applies pressure over the optic nerve proximal to the optic chiasm, it presents with medial (nasal) blindness in the visual field of the affected eye.\n\n \u25cf Crossed upper quadrantanopia: results from ischemia of the occipital lobe in the left visual cortex below the calcarine sulcus or due to damage of the inferior optic radiation in the temporal lobe, it presents with blindness in the upper medial visual field of the left eye and blindness in the upper lateral visual field of the right eye.\n\n \u25cf Crossed lower quadrantanopia: results from ischemia of the occipital lobe in the left visual cortex above the calcarine sulcus or due to damage of the superior optic radiation in the parietal lobe, it presents with blindness in the lower medial visual field of the left eye and blindness in the lower lateral visual field of the right eye.\n\n - Papilledema: is a consequence of increased intracranial pressure seen on fundoscopy. It is the bilateral swelling and pallor of the optic disc occurring concomitantly with signs and symptoms of intracranial hypertension. It is diagnosed clinically and assisted with CT scan. Management includes treatment of the underlying problem.\n\n - Amaurosis fugax: is an acute and painless onset of brief (lasting for minutes) monocular blindness occurring as a result of decreased blood supply commonly due to an atherosclerotic plaque or embolus of the internal carotid artery.\n\n - Central retinal artery occlusion: is a medical emergency characterized by sudden onset of painless blindness following an embolus impaction in the retinal in the retinal artery from the heart (atrial fibrillation or incompetent valves) or in temporal arteritis. It is diagnosed by fundoscopic examination of the eye which shows multiple retinal infarcts (cotton-wool spots; white-yellow dots), a pale retina, and cherry-red spots (retinal edema). Management of this condition includes IV diuretics (mannitol and acetazolamide), topical beta-blockers, massage of the eye glob to dislodge the embolis, and intra-arterial thrombolysis with fluid release.\n\n - Central retinal vein occlusion: is a condition characterized by sudden onset of painless blindness following a thrombotic blockage of the central retinal vein. The thrombus often arise from long lasting illnesses like, diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. It is diagnosed by fundoscopic examination of the eye which shows multiple retina infarcts (cotton-wool spots) and the characteristic blood and thunder appearance. Due to the decreased blood drainage, a potential macular swelling may arise and vitrous hemorrhage may occur with possible rupture of the veins. Management of this condition includes injection of bevacizumab and dexamethasone in to the eye globe.\n\n - Closed angle glaucoma: is a medical emergency characterized by a painful red eye with fixed pupil dilation and decreased visual acuity associated with severely increased intra-ocular pressure (above 40mmhg) and visualization of halos around lights due to macular edema. It is diagnosed clinically and managed with pilocarpine and laser peripheral iridotomy.\n\n - Open angle glaucoma: is a condition characterized by a gradually progressing increase in intra-ocular pressure that occurs bilaterally with one eye being more affected than the other at often times and progressive loss of peripheral vision. It is diagnosed by measuring the intra-ocular pressure and central corneal thickness, managed by latanoprost (prostaglandin F2 analogue).\n\n - Retinal detachment: is a condition characterized by separation of the functional retina from the pigmented retinal epithelium which can occur in three ways;\n \u25cf Rhegmatogenous detachment where pre-existing small tears of the retina resulting from advanced aging allow viterous fluid to accumulate posterior to the functional retina as the fluid builds up it pushes the retina leading to its detachment.\n \u25cf Tractional detachment refers to pre-existing scars formed in long-lasting illnesses such as diabetes apply a pulling force on the retinal thus resulting in its detachment.\n \u25cf Exudative detachment occurs in cases of infection or tumors which allow viterous fluid accumulation behind the retina without forming a tear.\n\n - Clinical presentation of retinal detachment: includes sudden onset of ligh flashes and floater shower followed by loss of peripheral vision that progress to central vision loss (macular invlovment).\n\n - Diagnosis of retinal detachment: diagnosis of this condition requires Brightness-scan ultrasound.\n\n - Management of retinal detachment: includes surgical viterectomy and/or scleral buckle procedure.\n\n - Viterous hemorrhage: is bleeding into the viterous body caused by trauma, CRVO, or retinal detachment. It presents with sudden onset of light flashed or floater shower (floating dots falling like a shower water) followed by sudden loss of vision. This condition is diagnosed by Brightness-scan ultrasound showing a hyperdense mass filling the viterous cavity, management of this condition includes surgical viterectomy.\n\n - Subconjunctival hemorrhage: is bleeding beneath the conjunctiva resulting from trauma, chronic uncontrolled hypertension, and strong paroxysmal coughing in children. No management is required if vision is intact as the blood is absorbed by the body within 2-3 week duration.\n\n\"",

The Q wave indicates interventricular septum depolarization, R wave indicates depolarization of the antero-lateral ventricular wall, and the S wave indicates depolarization of the lateral ventricular wall.\n\n \u25cf ST-segment: is the flat line between the end of the S and start of the T, this line reflects the phase of rapid ventricular ejection.\n\n \u25cf T-wave: reflects ventricular repolarization and the final stage of ventricular filling.\n\n \u2713 The ECG is mostly used to detect various pathologies of the heart and each cardiac pathology and their ECG readings will be detailed in their respective sections (see pathology of the heart).\n\n \u2713 An important concept to understand is that when taking an ECG reading there are positive and negative electrodes, a vector which is a theoretical line that correlates with the movement of an electrical impulse is what creates the waves on the ECG. When a vector moves towards the positive electrode it produces an elevated wave and when it moves away from the positive electrode it causes a depressed wave.\n\n \u2713 Leads of the ECG are 12 in total with three bipolar limb leads, three augmented unipolar limb leads, and six chest leads.\n\n - Bipolar limb leads:\n \u25cf Lead 1: generated by applying a negative electrode on the right arm and a positive electrode on the left arm, this lead views the heart in from the left lateral side.\n\n \u25cf Lead 2: generated by applying a negative electrode on the right arm and a positive electrode on the left leg, this lead views the inferior right side of the heart.\n\n \u25cf Lead 3: is generated by applying a negative electrode on the left arm and a positive electrode on the left leg, this lead looks at the inferior left side of the heart.\n\n - Augmented unipolar limb leads:\n \u25cf AvF: generated by applying a positive electrode on the left leg and a negative electrode on both the left and right arm, this lead views the inferior middle side of the heart.\n\n \u25cf AvR: generated by applying a positive electrode on the right arm and a negative electrode on both the left arm and leg, this lead views the supero-lateral right side of the heart.\n\n \u25cf AvL: generated by applying a positive electrode on the left arm and a negative electrode on both the left leg and right arm, this lead views the heart from the left lateral direction.\n\n - Chest leads (all are positive electrodes):\n \u25cf V1: placed at the right fourth intercostal space, it looks the interventricular septum.\n\n \u25cf V2: placed at the left fourth intercostal space, it looks at the interventricular septum.\n\n \u35cf V3: placed on the fifth rib between V2 and V4, it views the anterior part of the heart.\n\n \u25cf V4: placed at the fifth intercostal space on the mid-clavicular line, it views the anterior part of the heart.\n\n \u25cf V5: placed at the fifth intercostal space on the anterior axillary line, it views the left lateral side of the heart.\n\n \u25cf V6: placed at the fifth intercostal space on the mid-axillary line, it views the left lateral side of the heart.\n\n\"",

      "\"description_of_git_absorption\" : \"\n Absorption in the alimentary canal occurs mainly in the intestines where the small intestine is concerned with the absorption of carbohydrates, fats, proteins, and electrolytes while the large intestine is largely responsible for the absorption of water and electrolytes.\n\n - Absorption of carbohydrates: the digested monosaccharides, glucose, fructose, and galactose. Glucose and galactose are absorbed by the sodium-glucose transporter (SGLT) where this pump absorbs both glucose and galactose in addition to sodium from the intestinal lumen into the enterocyte. Fructose has its own channel called the GLUT5 which absorbs it from the lumen into the enterocyte with out a companion. At the baso-lateral side of the entrocytes we have GLUT2 pumps that open to the blood side, the monosaccharides diffuse through these pumps to eventually end up in the portal circulation.\n\n Absorption of lipids: once the micelles have formed from bile salts and bile acids action on the fat globules, they contain monoglycerides, fatty acids, and lipid-soluble vitamins. The micelles then diffuse passively through the villi into the entrocyte and enter the smooth endoplasmic reticulum to convert the monoglycerides to triglycerids and cholesterol to cholesterol esters, then these products move out of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum and into the rough endoplasmic reticulum where they get wrapped in a spherical body of phospholipids called chylomicron and an apo-protein called beta-lipoprotein. The chylomicron complex passes into the golgi apparatus to be secreted from the enterocyte via exocytosis into the lymphatic capillaries; from their the chymicrons travel to the thoracic duct to eventually empty into the blood.\n\n - Absorption of proteins: proteins are absorbed into the enterocyte by two types of pumps, a sodium co-transporter and a hydrogen proton co-transporter. The sodium pump absorbs amino acids and other peptides along with a sodium molecule into the enterocyte while the hydrogen pump absorbs the tripeptides, dipeptides and amino acids into the enterocyte along with a hydrogen proton. Within the entrocytes, the tripeptides and dipeptides are cleaved into amino acids by dipeptidases and tripeptidases, then those amino acids pass through a pump on the baso-lateral surface of the enterocyte via diffusion to enter the hepatic portal circulation.\n\n\"",

The mucus traps debris and the cilia propels the mucus upward to be expectorated.\n\n The trachea continues to run downward in the midline until it reaches the sternal angle (corresponds to the second costal cartilage and rib) where it bifurcates into right and left main bronchi.\n\n - Right main bronchi: it is short (2-2.5cm length), wide and more vertically oriented when compared to the left main bronchus (enters the lung at the level to T5 vertebra). Before it enters the lung the right main bronchus divides into upper and lower lobar bronchi which is why the hilum of the lung shows entry of two bronchi, however, the upper lobar bronchus supplies the upper lobe of the right lung by its segmental bronchi that it gives off upon entry and the lower lobar bronchus divides into middle and lower segmental bronchi upon entry thus supplying the middle and lower lobes of the right lung respectively.\n\n - Left main bronchus: is long (4-4.5 cm in length), narrow, and more obliquely oriented when compared to the right main bronchus (enters the lung at the level of T6 vertebra). It does not give off secondary branches outside the lung but rather divides into upper and lower lobar bronchi upon entry and the lobar bronchi would give off the segmental bronchi that would supply their respective lung fields.\n\n \u2713 Broncho-pulmonary segments: are parts of the lung that are supplied by segmental bronchi, the right lung has ten broncho-pulmonary segments while the left lung has nine segments.\n\n - Broncho-pulmonary segments of the right lung:\n \u25cf Superior segmental bronchus: gives off three segmental branches, an apical segmental branch, an anterior segmental branch, and a posterior segmental branch.\n\n \u25cf Middle segmental bronchus: gives off two branches, a medial branch and a lateral branch.\n\n \u25cf Inferior segmental bronchus: gives off five branches, a superior branch, a medial branch, a lateral branch, an anterior branch, and a posterior branch (all branches of the inferior segmental bronchus are basal branches except for the superior branch which is apical).\n\n - Broncho-pulmonary segments of the left lung:\n \u25cf Superior segmental bronchus: gives off five branches, an apical branch, an anterior branch, a posterior branch, a superior lingular branch, and an inferior lingular branch.\n\n \u25cf Inferior segmental bronchus: gives off four branches, a superior branch, a posterior basal branch, an anteromedial basal branch, and a lateral basal branch.\n\n - Bronchial tree: divided into conducting and respiratory zones.\n \u25cf Conducting zone: consists of the trachea (cartilage and ciliated linings), the right and left main bronchi (has cartilage and ciliated linings), the lobar bronchi (has cartilage and ciliated linings), segmental bronchi (has cartilage and ciliated linings), terminal bronchioles (no cartilage but has ciliated linings).\n\n \u25cf Respiratory zone: consists of respiratory bronchioles (made out of smooth muscles, has fewer cilia and no cartilage), alveolar ducts (made out of smooth muscles and has no cilia), alveoli (functioning unit of the lung; has no cilia and is made out of simple squamous cells).\n\n - Trachealis muscle: is a sheet-like smooth muscle that runs along the entire length of the trachea and covers the gap between the C-shaped cartilaginous rings posteriorly. It functions in constricting and dilating the trachea and receives innervation from the vagus nerve.\n\n - Blood supply of the trachea: the upper part of the trachea is supplied by the inferior thyroid arteries and the lower part of the trachea is supplied by the bronchial arteries (arise from the descending thoracic aorta).\n\n - Nerve supply of the trachea: it receives innervation from the reccurent laryngeal nerve which provides secreto-motor function to the glands and smooth muscles along with the sensory innervation of the tracheal linings.\n\n\"",

      "\"description_male_androgens\" : \"\n Male androgens are essential sex hormones that promote secondary sexual characteristics in males during pubertal ages and help maintain sexual physiology in addition to building the characteristic male physic with the main male androgen being testosterone.\n\n - Synthesis of testosterone: synthesized in both the adrenal gland and the testes but the dominant testosterone producing organ are the testes and both synthesis pathways have been described in physiology of reproduction - androgen synthesis.\n\n - Mechanism of action of testosterone: it carries out its action via the steroid hormone mechanism pathway. Testosterone, a lipid soluble hormone binds on to the extra-cellular receptors of the target organ located at the cell membrane or it could diffuse through the cell membrane and binds to its designated receptors in the cytoplasm thus forming a hormone-receptor complex. The hormone-receptor complex then enters the nucleus where it becomes embedded in the DNA for transcription. This transcription prompts the formation of a messenger RNA (mRNA) that leaves the nucleus and moves into the cytoplasm where it is translated into proteins that carry out the desired action meant by testosterone.\n\n - Functions of testosterone:\n \u25cf Promotes secondary sexual characteristics during pubertal age.\n \u25cf Increases muscle mass by over-stimulating the process of protein anabolism is muscle tissue.\n \u25cf Is the main factor in regulating male libido and the most essential element in spermatogenesis.\n \u25cf Is responsible for the growth and differentiation of the male reproductive organs.\n\n\"",

Management of this condition includes hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, gemcitabine and docetaxel.\n\n - Uterine serous carcinoma: is a condition characterized by the malignant proliferation of the epithelial cells of the endometrium due to a genetic mutation of the TP-53 gene (the precursor of the P-53 gene; cell cycle regulator and tumor suppressor), blood investigations reveal raised CA-125. It presents with symptoms similar to those of uterine sarcoma. This condition is diagnosed by transvaginal ultrasound and biopsy showing multi-nucleated cells with abundant basophil cytoplasm, hyperchromatic pleomorphic nuclei with prominent nucleoli, numerous mitotic figures and crypt-like spaces in between cells. Management of this condition includes hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, carboplatin, and docetaxel.\n\n - Cervical cancer: is a condition characterized by the malignant proliferation of the squamous epithelial cells lining the cervix (can also occur with glands; adenocarcinoma but it is rare), the cause of such malignant proliferation is due to excess estrogen exposure and chronic human papilloma virus (HPV16/18) infection. It presents with vaginal bleeding, pelvic pain, painful intercourse, bleeding during intercourse, bleeding after intercourse, foul-smelling debris-like vaginal discharge, and hematuria. This condition is screened for by the age of 25 via a pap-smear and is diagnosed by colposcopy and cone biopsy showing cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and hyperchromatic pleomorphic nuclei with prominent nucleoli and multiple keratin pearls in the background with numerous mitotic figures. Management of this condition includes hysterectomy, cisplatin, and gemcitabine.\n\n - Vaginal cancer: is a condition characterized by the malignant proliferation of the squamous epithelial cells lining the vagina, the cause of such malignant proliferation is yet to be determined, however, human papilloma virus exposure and di-ethyl-stelbesterol exposure have been strongly linked to this condition. It presents with symptoms similar to those of cervical cancer and is diagnosed by biopsy showing cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and hyperchromatic pleomorphic nuclei with prominent nucleoli and multiple keratin pearls in the background. Management of this condition includes external beam radiation, brachy-therapy, and cisplatin.\n\n\"",
      "\"description_pelvic_skeleton\" : \"\n The pelvic skeleton is an irregularly shaped structure formed by four bones; the sacrum, the ilium, the pubis, and the ischium.\n\n - The sacrum: forms the posterior part of the pelvis and when viewed anteriorly it resembles a cobra's neck. The sacrum shows a bulge that projects into the pelvic inlet called the sacral promontory and a wing-like lateral bony projection (that gives the sacrum a cobra's neck look) called the ala of sacrum.

      "\"description_male_genitalia_anatomy\" : \"\n The male genitalia consists of the scrotum, testis, epididymis, ductus deferens, seminal vesicles, ejaculatory ducts, prostate, prostatic urethra, bulbo-urethral gland, penile urethra, and the penis.\n\n - Scrotum: is a pouch-like sac of skin that holds the testis and epididymis within itself.\n\n - Layers of the scrotum:\n \u25cf Skin: the outermost layer and is heavily pigmented which gives the scrotum a darker color than the rest of the body.\n\n \u25cf Dartos fascia: is the layer lying just beneath the skin and contains the dartos muscle which functions in giving the scrotum its wrinkled appearance during cold weather.\n\n \u25cf External spermatic fascia: lies beneath the dartos fascia and is separated from it by loose areolar tissue. It is a thin layer of membrane that is a downward extension of the aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle of the abdomen, it also covers the spermatic cord.\n\n \u25cf Cremasteric fascia: lies beneath the external spermatic fascia and is formed by the cremasteric muscle that covers the spermatic cord and testis. It originates from the lowermost part of the internal oblique muscle and terminates into the tunica vaginalis. The cremaster muscle regulates testicular temperature by retracting the testis upward in cold weather and bringing it downwards in hot weather.\n\n \u25cf Internal spermatic fascia: is a thin layer that lies beneath the cremasteric fascia and is a downward extension of the tranversalis fascia. It also covers the spermatic cord.\n\n \u25cf Tunica vaginalis: is a double-layered membrane that covers the antero-lateral surfaces of the testis. It consists of the parietal layer which lies just beneath the internal spermatic fascia and is lined by simple squamous cells, the visceral layer which is firmly adherent to the surface of the testis and also attaches the epididymis to the testis, and the inter-layer fluid-filled cavity that renders the testis mobile in the scrotum.\n\n \u25cf Tunica albuginea: is a strong dense capsule that lies beneath the visceral layer of the tunica vaginalis and surrounds the testis. The tunica albuginea invaginates the testis to form septum-like structures between every unit of seminiferous tubules (the functioning part of the testis).\n\n - Testis: the tunica albuginea gives the testis its firm texture and with in the testis lies several structures.\n \u25cf Seminiferous tubules: are coiled tubules (300-600 coils) arranged is single units, they produce sperm cells.\n\n \u25cf Straight tubules: are single branches of the caudal ends of the seminiferous tubules and act as conduits in transferring sperm cells from the seminiferous tubules to the retes testis.\n\n \u25cf Retes testis: lies in the mediastinum of the testis (an area of fibrous tissue that extends from the upper pole to the lower pole of the internal posterior part of the testis), it is a network of collecting tubules that receive sperm cells from the straight tubules. The retes testis empties into the efferent ducutles (16-18 efferent ducutles) which exit the testis (carrying the sperm cells) and opens into the head of the epididymis.\n\n - Epididymis: is a coiled structure that runs along the outer posterior surface of the testis from the upper pole to the lower pole and is attached to the latter by the visceral layer of the tunica vaginalis. The inferior part of the epididymis called the tail of the epididymis opens in to the ducuts deferens, a tube that carries the sperm cells to the prostatic urethra. The epididymis functions in housing and maturation of the sperm cells.\n\n Ductus deferens: is a duct that ascends via the spermatic cord through the inguinal canal and enters the pelvis above. In the pelvis, it descends medially behind the urinary bladder where it lies adjacent to the seminal vesicle and forms dilations called the ampulla of ductus deferens. The ductus deferens then joins the duct of the seminal vesicle to form the ejaculatory duct which opens into the prostatic urethra.\n\n - Seminal vesicle: is a coiled accessory gland that lies adjacently lateral to the ampulla of the ductus deferens and posterior to the urinary bladder, it also shares the ejaculatory duct with the dutus deferens. The coils of the seminal vesicle often form out-pouching areas and these areas contain the secretory glands whom secretions from the majority of the seminal fluid contents.\n\n - Prostate: is an inverted walnut-shaped gland located below the urinary bladder, it surrounds a part of the urethra called the prostatic urethra. The ejaculatory ducts open into the prostate and their contents are mixed with and added upon by secretions of the prostate thus the seminal vesicles and the prostate gland form the liquid part of the semen, the semen then exits the prostate through the prostatic openings present in the prostatic urethra.\n\n - The prostate gland is enclosed by a two-layered capsule:\n \u25cf False capsule: the outermost fibrous layer of the prostatic capsule and is a derived from the pelvic fascia, it is separated from the true capsule by a plexus of veins.\n\n \u25cf True capsule: a dense fibrous layer that is firmly adherent to the surface of the prostate and resembles the visceral layer of membrane in its adherence.\n\n \u2713 The prostate is compartmentalized microscopically into four zones and grossly into four lobes.\n\n - Zones of the prostate:\n \u25cf Anterior fibromuscular zone: lies anterior to the prostatic urethra and occupies the anterior and antero-lateral compartments of the prostate and it as the name suggests it is made out of fibromuscular tissue and lacks glandular tissue.\n\n \u25cf Transitional zone: encircles the prostatic urethra with its mass majority lying anterior to the urethra and posterior to the fibromuscular zone, it constitutes 5 percent of the glandular units in the prostate.\n\n \u25cf Central zone: lies behind the posterior part of the transitional zone and is pierced by the ejaculatory ducts, it constitutes 25 percent of glandular units in the prostate.\n\n \u25cf Peripheral zone: is the largest of all zones and extends from the posterior compartment of the prostate to the antero-lateral part (where it lies posterior to the fibromuscular zone) of the prostate forming a C-shaped pattern, it constitutes 75 percent of the glandular units in the prostate.\n\n - Lobes of the prostate:\n \u25cf Anterior lobe: lies anterior to the prostatic urethra and within it lies the transitional zone and the anterior fibromuscular zone.\n\n \u25cf Middle lobe: lies just posterior to the urethra and is dubbed middle as it lies right in the middle of all the other lobes, the posterior part of the transitional zone and part of the central zone lies within this lobe.\n\n \u25cf posterior lobe: Lies posterior to the middle lobe (obviously forms the posterior part of the prostate), part of the central zone and the median part of the peripheral zone lies within this lobe.\n\n \u25cf Lateral lobes: they form the majority of the prostate as they extend postero-laterally, laterally, and antero-laterally. The postero-lateral part of the peripheral zone, the lateral part of the peripheral zone, the antero-lateral part of the anterior fibro-muscular zone lies within this lobe.\n\n - Bulbo-urethral glands: a pair of small rounded glands often described as a pea-shaped mass, lies infero-posterior to the prostate gland and each gland has a single duct that opens into the spongy urethra, they functions in releasing a fluid that lubricates the spongy urethra thus providing a smooth passage for the semen to pass through.\n\n - Penis: divided into root, shaft, and glans.\n \u25cf Root of the penis: is attached to the superficial perineal membrane in the urogenital triangle of the perineum. It is formed by a pair of penile crura that extends along the lateral margins of the superficial perineal membrane and are covered by the ischiocavernous muscle, it is also formed by the bulb of the penis which lies in the midline of the perineal membrane and is covered by the bulbospongiosus muscle (both muscles are explained in the perineum section). The root of the penis is attached to the pubic symphysis by the suspensory ligament of the penis.\n\n \u25cf Body of the penis: it is formed by a pair of corpora cavernosa above which are downward extensions of the penile crura and by the corpus spongiosum which is the downward extension of the penile bulb (the corpus spongiosum contains the urethra). The corpora cavernosa are singularly enclosed by a circular layer of fibrous tissue called the tunica albuginea and are separated from one another by a fibrous septum called the septum penis. The corpus spongiosum and corpora cavernosa are enclosed together by the fascia of penis.\n\n \u25cf Head of the penis: is formed by the glans penis which is the anterior expansion of the corpus spongiosum, with its circumferential base called the penile corona forming the boundary between the body and head of penis.\n\n - Blood supply of the reproductive organs:\n \u25cf Scrotum: is supplied by the anterior scrotal artery (branch of the deep external pudendal artery which originates from the external iliac artery), the posterior scrotal artery (branch of the internal pudendal artery which originates from the internal iliac artery), the cremasteric artery (a branch of the inferior epigastric artery), and the testicular arteries (direct branches of the abdominal aorta).\n\n \u25cf Epididymis: it receives most of its blood supply from the testicular arteries though the arterial vessels supplying the scrotum.\n\n \u25cf Ductus deferens: is supplied by the artery of ductus deferens (a branch of the superior vesical artery which originates from the internal iliac artery) and the inferior vesical artery (a branch of the internal iliac artery).\n\n \u25cf Seminal vesicle: receives its blood supply from internal pudendal artery (branch of the internal iliac artery), inferior vesical artery, and middle rectal artery (a branch of the internal iliac artery).\n\n \u25cf Prostate: receives blood supply from inferior vesical artery, middle rectal artery, and the internal pudendal artery.\n\n \u25cf Bulbo-urethral gland: receives blood supply from the bulbo-urethral artery (a branch of the internal pudendal artery).\n\n \u25cf Penis: receives blood supply from the dorsal artery of penis (a branch of the internal pudendal artery) which runs on along the dorsal surface of the penis, the cavernous/deep artery of the penis (a branch of the internal pudendal artery) which runs within the corpus cavernosum along the entire length of the penis, and the artery of bulb of penis (a branch of the internal pudendal artery) which runs within the penile fascia supplying both the bulb of penis and the penile urethra.\n\n\"",

      "\"description_congenital_cardiac_pathologies\" : \"\n Congenital cardiac defects are those occurring during the embryonic phase of development.\n\n - Pulmonary valve stenosis: is a congenital disorder of the cardiac pulmonary valves characterized by partial fusion of the valve leaflets. The newborn will appear asymptomatic wth an associated mid-systolic ejection murmur on the left second intercostal space. This condition is diagnosed by echocardiogram and managed with surgical valve replacement at six months of life.\n\n - Aortic valve stenosis: is a congenital disorder of the cardiac aortic valves characterized by partial fusion of the valve leaflets. The neonate will have difficulty breathing and will appear pale (severe stenosis leads to metabolic acidosis) with a mid-systolic ejection murmur on the right second intercostal space that radiates to the neck resulting in characteristic carotid thrill. This condition is diagnosed by echocardiogram and managed with surgical valve replacement during the first six months of life.\n\n - Coarctation of the aorta: is a congenital disorder of the aorta characterized by a constriction blocking the outflow tract of the left ventricle. The patient neonate presents with a collapsing pulse and ongoing hypovolemic shock (metabolic acidosis). This condition is diagnosed by echocardiogram and managed with cardiac catherterization with ballon angioplasty.\n\n - Transposition of the great arteries: is a congenital cardiac disorder characterized by the aorta arising from the right ventricle and the pulmonary trunk arising from the left ventricle. The newborn appears extremely cyanotic after birth, this condition is diagnosed by echocardiogram assisted with cardiac catheterization and managed with arterial switch surgery.\n\n - Tetralogy of fallot: is a congenital cardiac disorder characterized by four main features; stenotic outflow of the pulmonary tract, right ventricular hypertrophy, ventricular septal defect, and an that is aorta over-riding the ventricular septal defect. The features described favor the formation of a right to left shunt thus the newborn presents with cyanosis and systolic ejection murmur on the left fourth intercostal space. This condition is diagnosed by echocardiogram and managed with complex cardiac surgical repair.\n\n - Atrial septal defect: is a congenital cardiac disorder characterized by a hole in the inter-atrial septum often involving the foramen ovale and is called ostium secondum (ostium primum occurs more with down syndrome). The defect results in a left to right shunt and the newborn appears breathless (later in life, children with ASD contract frequent chest infections) with a mid-holosystolic ejection murmur heard at the left second intercostal space with splitting of the second heart sound.

      "\"description_cardiac_parameters\" : \"\n Understanding cardiac parameters is essential in learning how the heart works as they form the basis of cardiac physiology since all the parameters are interrelated and function as one unit that serves the heart's pumping mechanism.\n\n \u25cf Stroke volume: is the amount of blood being ejected per ventricular contraction and it has been estimated to be 70-75mL in a normal individual. It is worth noting that stroke volume can be theoretically calculated by the difference between the end-diastolic volume and the end-systolic volume and we will be getting to the definition of each later in this section (SV=EDV-ESV).\n\n \u25cf Cardiac output: holds the same concept as stroke volume but is associated with a time unit variable which is minutes. So to put matter in perspective, cardiac output is the amount of blood ejected from the ventricle per minute which has been estimated to be 5000mL/min (5L/hr) in a normal individual. The cardiac output is directly related to two factors, the stroke volume and heart rate where if one of those two were to change it would have a direct impact on the cardiac output since the latter could be theoretically calculated (CO=SVxHR).\n\n \u25cf Venous return: is the amount of blood returning to the right atrium from the entire body and it is equal in value to the cardiac output, hence the heart only pumps out what it receives therefore venous return and cardiac output are the same in value and are directly proportional. The stroke volume can be theoretically calculated by taking into consideration three variables, the venous pressure, right arterial pressure, and the venous vascular resistance where we subtract the venous pressure from the right arterial pressure then their sum is divided by the venous vascular resistance.\n\n \u25cf Ejection fraction: is the value in percentage given to the amount of blood being ejected per ventricular contraction and is also partly determined by the end-diastolic volume, the EF tells us how well the heart is contracting and is one of the essential values in determining heart failure as ejection fraction is directly proportional to contractility. Ejection fraction can be theoretically determined by two factors which are the stroke volume and end-diastolic volume with the equation expressed as EF=SV/EDV.\n\n \u25cf Preload: is the pressure exerted on the myocytes from their fibers being stretched as the ventricle is filled with blood just prior to contraction and is directly proportional to stroke volume. Factors decreasing preload are increased heart rate (the heart is pumping fact and inefficient) and dehydration/hemorrhage (hypovolemia). Factors increasing preload are respiratory inspiration (increased intrabdominal pressure increases venous return), exercise, skeletal muscle contraction (increases nenous return).\n\n \u25cf Afterload: is the pressure exerted by the contracting ventricle through its wall's tension against the valve inorder for it to open and blood is ejected. Factors decreasing afterload are venous dilating medications and factors increasing afterload are valvular stenosis, high systemic blood pressure and increased blood viscosity.\n\n \u25cf End-diastolic volume: is the total amount of blood that has been collected in the ventricular chamber at the end of cardiac diastole/relaxation. The end-diastolic volume is an important variable that is concerned with other cardiac parameters as mentioned earlier.\n\n \u25cf End-systolic volume: is the total amount of blood remaining in the ventricle at the end of cardiac systole/contraction.\n\n \u25cf Stroke work: is the total action the heart partakes in while working a single beat. Since the heart or the ventricle rather is pumping out blood, this action is called stroke volume and since the ventricle must accumulate afterload to push against the aortic valve it is actually working against the aortic pressure therefore two variables determine stroke work and they are the stroke volume and aortic pressure where both are directly proportional. Stroke work can be theoretically calculated as SW=SVxAP.\n\n \u25cf Cardiac minute work: holds the same concept as stroke work except it is associated with a time unit variable where instead of stroke volume we are using cardiac output, CMW=COxAP.\n\n\"",

The first order neuron are the corticobulbar fibers that arise from the pyramidal cells in the precentral gyrus and adjacent part of the postcentral gyrus that descend through the corona radiata and the genu of the internal capsule passing through the midbrain and synapsing with the cranial nerve nuclei directly or indirectly via internuncial neurons which are the second order neuron and from their fibers descend to the third order neuron which is the lower motor neuron.\n\n \u25cf General visceral motor nuclei: is concerned with the parasympathetic outflow of cranial nerves and they are edinger-westphal nucleus of oculomotor nerve, the superior salivatory and lacrimal nuclei of facial nerve, inferior salivatory nucleus of glossopharyngeal nerve and the dorsal motor nucleus of the nagus nerve.\n\n - Olfactory nerve: it arises from the olfactory receptor cells located in the upper part of the nasal cavity above the superior concha. The olfactory receptor cells give rise to olfactory hairs that project into the mucus covering the surface of the mucous membrane, the olfactory hairs react to smell and stimulate the olfactory cells. From the olfactory cells arise the olfactory nerves (unmyelinated but covered with schwann cells) that pass through the openings present in the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone to reach the olfactory bulb. The olfactory bulb contains mitral cells where the incoming olfactory fibers synapse with its dendrites forming synaptic glomeruli (the olfactory bulb also receives nerve fibers from the contralateral side). The fibers are carried from the olfactory bulb to the brain via the olfactory tract and once it reaches the anterior perforated substance, the tract divides into medial olfacotry striae which carries crossing fibers in the anterior commissure to the olfactory bulb of the opposite side and lateral olfactory striae which carries the nerve fibers to the olfactory area of the cerebral cortex, the periamygdaloid and prepiriform areas collectively known as the primary olfactory area. The primary olfactory area sends out fibers to the secondary olfactory area which is the entorhinal area of the hippocampal gyrus and both areas of the cortex process olfactory information.\n\n - Optic nerve: the nerve fibers of the optic nerve (myelinated and covered with oligodendrocytes) originate from the ganglionic layer of the retina and exit the eye at the optic disc passing through the optic canal to the optic chiasma. The optic chiasma is where the crossing of the nerve fibers occur, fibers of from the medial side (nasal) of the retina cross the midline to the contralateral optic tract and the fibers from the lateral side (temporal) of the retina do not cross but continue to the ipsilateral optic tract. The optic tract (contains the ipsilateral temporal nerve fiber and contralateral nasal nerve fiber) is the posterior continuation of the optic chiasma and passes posterolaterally around the cerebral peduncle and terminate in the lateral geniculate body from the pulvinar of the thalamus, however some fibers pass to the pretectal and supeior colliculs of the midbrain taking role in light reflexes. From the lateral geniculate body the axons form the emerging optic radiation which passes posteriorly through the retrolenticular part of the internal capsule to terminate in the viusal cortex (the upper and lower lip of the calcarine sulcus on the medial surface of the cerebral hemisphere).\n\n - Oculomotor nerve: posses two nuclei the main motor nucleus and the accessory parasympathetic nucleus.\n\n \u25cf Main motor nucleus: lies in the anterior part of the gray matter that surrounds the cerebral aqueduct of the midbrain at the level of the superior colliculus. The oculomotor nucleus is composed of neurons supplying the extrinsic muscles of the eyes with the exception of superior oblique and lateral rectus muscles. The main oculomotor nucleus receives corticonuclear fibers from both hemospheres, receives tectobulbar fibers from the superior colliculus (therefore receives information from the visual cortex), receives fibers from the medial longitudinal fasciculus (therefore connceted with the nuclei of fourth, sixth, eighth vranial nerves).\n\n \u25cf Accessory parasympathetic nucleus: lies posterior to the main oculomotor nucleus and receives corticonuclear fibers that are concerned with acoomodation and fibers from the pretectal nucleus for light reflexes.\n\n - Trochlear nerve: located in the anterior part of the gray matter surrounding the cerebral aqueduct of the midbrain at the level of the inferior colliculus.

The trochlear nevre is the only cranial nerve leaving through the posterior surface of the brainstem and exiting from the midbrain to decussate with the contralateral nerve. It enters the orbit through the superior orbital fissure to supply the oblique muscle of the eye (moving the eye downward and laterally).\n\n - Trigeminal nerve: the trigeminal nerve divides into three nerve branches; the ophthalmic, maxillary and mandibular nerves. It also consist of four nuclei; main sensory nucleus situated in the posterior part of the pons lateral to the nucleus and is inferiorly continuos with the spinal nucleus, spinal nucleus extends inferiorly along the medulla oblongata to the second cervical segment, mesencephalic nucleus lies in the lateral part of the gray matter surrounding the cerebral aqueduct and descends inferiorly along the pons till the main sensory nucleus, and the motor nucleus which lies medial to the main sensory nucleus.\n\n - Sensory portions of the trigeminal nerve: conveys sensations from the face and the mucous membranes of the face to the trigeminal sensory ganglion and is divided into ascending and descending fibers. The ascending fibers terminate in the main sensory nucleus and the descending fibers terminate in the spinal nucleus. however, touch and pressure sensations terminate into the main sensory nucleus, pain and temperature sensations terminate into the spinal nucleus, proprioceptive sensation terminate in the sensory root of the trigeminal nerve, sensory fibers of the ophthalmic division terminate into the inferior part of the spinal nucleus, fibers from the maxillary division terminate into the middle of the spinal nucleus, fibers from the mandibular division terminate into the superior part of the spinal nucleus.

Efferent fibers from the nuclei pass through the pons to enter the posterior nucleus of the trapezoid body and the superior olivary nucleus, they then ascend along the posterior ascpect of the pons and midbrain as the lateral lemniscus. The lateral lemniscus then passes to the nucleus of the inferior colliculus then the medial geniculate body then the acoustic radiation of the internal capsule to eventually terminate in the auditory cotex.\n\n - Glossopharyngeal nerve: involved in sensory and motor in sensory and motor innervation of the oropharynx and is also involved in heart physiology.\n\n - Nuclei of the glossopharyngeal nerve:\n \u25cf Main motor nuclei: formed by the upper part of the nucleus ambiguus and lies in the reticular formation of the medulla oblongata, it receives afferent corticonuclear fibers from the cerebral cortex and sends efferent fibers to supply the stylopharyngeus muscle.\n\n \u25cf Sensory nucleus of glossopharyngeal nerve: being part of the nucleus of tractus solitarus where afferent nerve fibers of taste sensation synapse, it is also involved in the control of blood pressure (but we will be talking only about taste sensations here).

      "\"description_blood_fluid_pressure\" : \"\n Blood pressure is the pressure generated by the heart to pump blood into the peripheral circulation and the pressure exerted by the blood on the vessel walls where a number of factors contribute to maintain a normal blood pressure. Several terms are used to describe blood pressure in the peripheral arteries and the blood pressure value most commonly used reflects that of large arteries.\n\n - Mean arterial pressure: is the pressure value collected from a person's large artery and it is the value mostly referred to and sought for.\n\n - Total vascular resistance: is the pressure in the arteries that needs to be overcome inorder to create and maintain blood flow. Factors contributing to this are the type of arteries (arterioles have the highest resistance since their walls are continuously being acted upon by the sympathetic system thus are always contacting), sympathetic activity (vasoconstriction applies more resistance), and blood viscosity (the thicker the blood, the higher the resistance).\n\n - Systolic blood pressure: is the pressure measured post left ventricular ejection and marks the highest reading of blood pressure.\n\n - Diastolic blood pressure: is the pressured measured during ventricular relaxation/repolarization and marks the lowest reading of blood pressure.\n\n - Pulse pressure: is the sum of the difference between the systolic and diastolic pressure often reflects the stroke volume.\n\n - Parallel vascular domain: is where arteries branch out to supply different areas of the body and each artery has its own vascular resistance, since blood is being divided into these vessels the resistance decreases and the more blood being added the lower the resistance gets.\n\n - Series vascular domain: is when blood vessels do not branch but are rather arranged in a straight line/series (theoretically), meaning that we have blood flowing through a non branching straight vessel that alters its characteristics as it move forward by changing from and artery to arteriole to venule to vein. Here, resistance increases as more blood flows through because the vessel develops more resistance as it alters its characteristic.\n\n - Vascular conductance: describes the blood flowing through a vessel, vessels with higher conductance tend to have a larger diameter therefore blood flows rapidly through unlike those with smaller diameter that have lower conductance where blood flows slower (blood flows slowest in the capillaries).\n\n - Vascular compliance: is the vessels ability to carry blood and expand inorder to accommodate the blood's volume, arteries have the least compliance since their walls are of hard elastic nature and thus don't support dilatation meanwhile veins are of high compliance and are able to dilate thereby accumulating more blood.\n\n \u2713 Many indigenous reactions especially from the endocrine and renal systems play a vital role in maintaining blood pressure so does other factors such as drugs and edibles and those will be detailed in their respective chapters.\n\n Fluid/plasma pressure is crucial to blood volume and blood pressure as a change in the plasma pressure results in unwanted changes that will be explained later in this chapter.\n\n \u2713 The plasma has four forces acting upon it that ensure a non-changing plasma volume within the vessels.\n\n - Forces acting upon plasma:\n \u25cf Capillary hydrostatic pressure: as blood flows through the vessels it exerts its pressure on the vessel wall and due to the strong pressure (if unopposed) the fluid (not the blood) is able to leave through the endothelial cells of the vessel wall to the interstitium as if it were to be filtered. If the hydrostatic pressure were to increase by vasodilation, heart failure (most common), or other causes this would result in fluid leakage and if the capillary oncotic pressure fails to oppose this force then edema occurs.\n\n \u25cf Capillary oncotic pressure: is the pressure that opposes the capillary hydrostatic pressure, it is the pressure that keeps the fluid from leaking out through the endothelial cells of the vessels achieved by plasma proteins. The dominant plasma protein albumin that is manufactured by the liver is responsible for this pressure as it retains the fluid by allowing its particles to bind to it. If the capillary oncotic pressure decreases due to a liver pathology or other causes, the fluid will leak through the capillaries and result in edema since few plasma proteins are present to withhold fluid leakage.\n\n \u25cf Interstitial hydrostatic pressure: is the pressure of the fluid present in the interstitium that opposes the capillary hydrostatic pressure thus preventing leakage/filtration of the fluid outside the vessel.\n\n \u25cf Interstitial oncotic pressure: is the pressure exerted by the proteins present in the interstitium, this pressure acts upon the fluid in the vessels in a suctioning mechanism pulling out the fluid to the interstitium. This pressure is opposed by capillary oncotic pressure and interstitial hydrostatic pressure.\n\n\"",
      "\"description_male_puberty\" : \"\n The hypothalamus secretes GnRH which stimulates the release of FSH and LH from the anterior pituitary gland, these hormones are secreted in small quantities since they are required to be intermittent and pulsatile in character.

The purkinje cells have two main input fibers that relay excitatory impulses to them and they are climbing fibers and mossy fibers as for the inhibitory impulse they originate from the stellate and basket cells. The excitatory mossy and climbing fibers have glutamate as their excitatory neurotransmitter on the purkinje cell dendrites.\n\n - Cerebellar afferent fibers:\n \u25cf cotrico-ponto-cerebellar tract: arise from the cerebral cortex specifically from the frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital lobes descending through the corona radiata and internal capsule terminating in the pontine nuclei from which arises the transverse fibers of the pons that cross the midline to the opposite side and enter the cerebellar hemisphere through the middle cerebellar peduncle ending up as mossy fibers in the cerebellum (they coordinate planned motor function).\n\n \u25cf Cerebro-olivary-cerebellar tract: originate from the frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital lobes of the cerebral cortex, descending through the corona radiata and internal capsule terminating in the inferior olivary nuclei which gives rise to fibers that cross the midline to the opposite side and enter the cerebellar hemisphere through the inferior cerebellar peduncle ending up as climbing fibers in the cerebellum (functions in learning motor movments).\n\n \u25cf Cerebro-reticulo-cerebellar tract: arise from many different areas of the cerebral cortex and terminate in the reticular formation of the pons and meduula at both sides. The reticular formation gives rise to the reticulo-cerebellar fibers that enter the cerebellar hemisphere through the middle and inferior cerebellar peduncles (relays conscious voluntary motor activity).\n\n \u25cf Anterior spino-cerebellar tract and posterior spino-cerebellar tract: see ascending and descending fibers section.\n\n \u25cf Cuneo-cerebellar tract: originates from nucleus cuneatus in the medulla oblongata (do not cross) and enter the cerebellum through the inferior cerebellar peduncle and terminating as mossy fibers in the cerebellum.\n\n \u25cf vestibulo-cerebellar tract: originates from the vestibular nerve which receives information about motion and position from the inner ear. The vestibular nerve sends fibers (do not cross) that enter the cerebellum through the inferior cerebellar peduncle and some of the vestibular fibers pass to the vestibular nuclei in the brainstem where they synapse, then enter the cerebellum through the inferior cerebellar peduncle of the same side. These fibers terminate as mossy fibers in the cerebellum.\n\n - Cerebellar efferent fibers (all efferent fibers coming out of the cerebellum are purkinje fibers):\n \u25cf Globose-emboliform-rubral tract: originates from the globose and emboliform nuclei (receives information projecting from the intermediate regions of the cerebellar cortex), first the fibers pass through the superior cerebellar peduncle to the out side of the cerebellum where they cross the midline at the deccusation of the superior serebellar peduncles and synape on the contralateral red nucleus, the red nucleus then gives rise to the rubrospinal tract which again crosses the midline to its original side (if it starts in the left it will cross to the right then from the right it would cross back to the left).\n\n \u25cf Dentothalamic tract: originates from the dentate nucleus (output of the lateral part of the cerebellar hemispheres) whose fibers exit the cerebellum through the superior cerebellar peduncle crossing the midline at the decussation of the superior cerebellar peduncle and synapsing in the ventrolateral nucleus of the thalamus, from there the fibers ascend through the internal capsule and corona radiata to terminate in the primary motor area of the cerebral cortex and descend from the cerebral cortex via the corticospinal tract, remember that the corticospinal tract crosses to the opposite side at the decussation of pyramids (meaning the dentatothalamic tract first crosses to the opposite side then crosses back to its original side again).\n\n \u25cf Fastigial vestibular tract: originates from the fastigial nucleus with its fibers leaving the cerebellum through the inferior cerebellar peduncle to synapse in the lateral vestibular nucleus on both sides of the body. The lateral vestibular nucleus gives rise to the vestibulospinal tract that eventually terminate in the ipsilateral motor neurons of the spinal cord.\n\n \u25cf Fastigial reticular tract: originates from the fastigial nucleus (receives information projecting from the vermis of the cerebellum), leaves the cerebellum through the inferior cerebellar peduncle and synapse with the neurons in the reticular formation (do not cross), from the reticular formation the fibers descend to influence the motor neurons of the spinal cord via the reticulospinal tract. The cerebellum exerts its action on the cerebral cortex and the brainstem and not on the lower motor neurons (action is conveyed to the lower motor neurons via the descending tracts of the spinal cord).\n\n\"",

It also shows the impressions of the mediastinal structures that are situated on the medial side of the lung.\n\n \u25cf Costal surface: is the anterior surface of the lung facing the ribs, however it is separated from latter by the parietal pleura.\n\n \u25cf Diaphragmatic surface: is the concave part of the lung facing the diaphragm.\n\n - Borders of the lung (separates the surfaces from one another):\n \u25cf Anterior border: lies at the anteromedial part of the lung, it separates the costal surface from the mediastinal surface of the lung.\n\n \u25cf Inferior border: lies at the base of the lung, it separates the mediastinal and costal surfaces form the diaphragmatic surfaces.\n\n \u25cf Posterior border: lies at the posterior part of the lung, it separates the costal surface from the mediastinal surface posteriorly.\n\n - Visceral pluera: is the pleural layer that lines the external surface of the lung and is firmly adherent to it. The visceral pleura also lines the fissures of the lung and meets with the parietal pleura at the hilum (point of entry for structures into the lung) to form the pulmonary ligament. The visceral pleura receives blood supply from the same arteries supplying the lung via the bronchial arteries. It receives innervation from the vagus nerve and the sympathetic trunk thus making it insensitive to pain or touch and only can sense stretch.\n\n - Parietal pleura: is the pleural layer that lines internal surfaces of the rib cage, it lines the ribs and intercostal spaces (costal pleura), the diaphragm (diaphragmatic pleura), the mediastinum (mediastinal pleura), and the apex of the lung (cervical pleura), it receives blood supply from the intercostal arteries. The costal pleura is innervated by the intercostal nerves, the mediastinal and diaphragmatic pleurae are innervated by the phrenic nevre, and the cervical pleura is innervated by the intercostal nerves.\n\n - Pleural cavity: is a thin space that is sandwiched between the visceral and parietal pleura containing a thin film of clear fluid that provides a frictionless environment during lung expansion allowing the pleura to smoothly slide against each other.\n\n - The right lung: is divided into three lobes (upper, middle, lower) by two fissures, horizontal and oblique fissures. The horizontal fissure begins at the level of the fourth costal cartilage and runs laterally to terminate in the oblique fissure, it separates the upper lobe from the middle lobe. The oblique fissure begins at medial side of the lung's base and runs upward and backward reaching the upper part of the lung just almost six centimeters below the apex, it separates the upper lobe from the middle lobe and the middle lobe from the inferior lobe.\n\n - The hilum of the right lung shows entry of the following structures:\n \u2022 Two bronchi.\n \u2022 Two pulmonary veins.\n \u2022 One bronchial artery.\n \u2022 One pulmonary artery.\n\n - Impressions on the mediastinal surface of the right lung:\n \u2022 The heart.\n \u2022 The superior vena cava and inferior vena cava.\n \u2022 The esophagus (behind the hilum)\n \u2022 The azygos vein (curves above hilum and runs posterior to esophagus).\n\n - Left lung: has only two lobes,upper and lower, and both are separated from one another by an oblique fissure. The oblique fissure begins from the medial part of the inferior border of the lung (levels with the sixth costal cartilage) and runs superolateraly on the costal surface reaching the reaching the mid-axillary line (at the level of the fourth rib).\n\n - The hilum of the left lung shows entry of the following structures:\n \u2022 One bronchus.\n \u2022 Two pulmonary veins.\n \u2022 Two bronchial arteries.\n \u2022 One pulmonary artery.\n\n - Impressions on the mediastinal surface of the left lung:\n \u2022 The heart.\n \u2022 The aortic arch.\n \u2022 The descending thoracic aorta.\n \u2022 The esophagus.\n\n \u2713 The pleura doesn't entirely cover the lungs at certain points but rather is seen to form empty spaces called pleural recesses, these spaces provide extra space when the lung is hyper-expanded during inspiration.\n - The costomediastinal recess: seen at proximity to the base of the lung but most prominently at the costal surface of the pleura (levels with costal cartilages of ribs four to six) and is formed by the union of costal and mediastinal pleura (overlying the heart's apex).\n\n - The costodiaphragmatic recess: it is larger than the costomediastinal recess and is seen to be extending from the eighth rib to the tenth rib at the mid-axillary line and from the medial side of the lung to the curve of the those ribs at the mid-axillary line, and is formed by union of the costal and diaphragmatic recess. It is the space where fluid tends accumulate during pleural effusion.\n\n - Blood supply of the lung: the lung receives deoxygenated blood from the pulmonary veins which are branches of the pulmonary trunk and oxygented blood from bronchial arteries which are branches from the descending thoracic aorta.\n\n - Nerve supply of the lung: the lung receives sympatheic innervation from the sympathetic trunk and cardiac plexus but receives parasympathetic innervation from the vagus nerve. The nerves supplying the lung are collectively knows as the pulmonary plexus which is divided into anterior and posterior divisions based on their position to the lung's root.\n\n\"",

The signs and symptoms of cerebrovascular insufficiency are sudden and arise once the area affected has lost its arterial blood supply since the signs and symptoms are only consistent with the area affected.\n\n - Stroke: defined as damage to the brain tissue due to vascular insufficiency while transient ischemic attack is the presence of vascular insufficiency with no resultant damage to the brain tissue.\n\n \u2713 Stroke can be defined as hemorrhagic or ischemic in origin and are differentiated from one another by computed tomography where hemorrhage mostly appears as a white (hyperdense) ill-defined lesion that shows a wider display of surface area on CT while ischemic tissue appears pale on CT. An exception to this unspoken rule is the presence of a thrombus in one of the major arteries of the brain which then appears as white well-demarcated dot.\n\n - Causes of ischemic stroke:\n \u25cf Ccclusion of the major arteries such as the internal carotid artery by an atherosclerotic plaque or blockage of major cerebral arteries with a thrombus.\n\n \u25cf Chronic hypertension which causes leakage of hyaline proteins intot he vessel wall thus increasing arterial wall thickness and decreasing lumen caliber causing disruption of blood flow with resultant ischemia.\n\n \u25cf Diabetes which causes non-enzymatic glycation of the arterial wall with more damage directed toward the tunica intima, this enhances the formation of atherosclerotic plaques and eventually disrupting blood flow.\n\n \u25cf Cardiogenic causes such as valvular insufficiency or emboli that often occur with atrial fibrillation, prosthetic valves and septal defects (mostly are atrial septal defects).\n\n - Causes of hemorrhagic stroke:\n \u25cf Chronic hypertension is most notorious for causing hemorrahgic stroke as it leads to aneurysm which is the weakening and ballooning of the vessel wall due to prolonged increased luminal pressure, this causes weakening of the vessel wall and increases its susceptibility for rupture.\n\n \u25cf Trauma is the second most common causes of vessel rupture of the cerebral arteries leading to hemorrhagic shock.\n\n \u2713 Signs and symptoms of stroke are basically deficits of the areas of brain tissue affected due to decreases blood supply, the following segment will discuss the signs symptoms risen from compromisation of the cerebral arteries.\n\n - Site-specific signs and symptoms of stroke:\n \u25cf Anterior cerebral artery: a stroke originating from this artery results in impaired cognition and judgment, contra-lateral lower limb motor and sensory deficits, and urinary incontinence.\n\n \u25cf Middle cerebral artery: a stroke originating from this artery results in contra-lateral motor and sensory deficits of the face and upper limbs, deviation of the pupil towards site of lesion (if right middle cerebral artery is affected right pupil is deviated to the right), broca's aphasia if left hemisphere is affected (inability to form fine grammatical full-sentences with impaired and incoherent speech), wernicke's aphasia if inferior temporal lobe is affected (impaired understanding of speech, able to form fine grammatical fluent sentences but hold no meaning), global aphasia if both broca's and wernicke's area are affected (inability to express or understand meaning of speech), and contra-lateral homonymos hemianopia by damaging the visual radiation fibers exiting the lateral geniculate nucleus.\n\n \u25cf Posterior cerebral artery: a stroke originating from this artery causes contra-lateral homonomys hemianopia or contra-lateral quadrantanopia (if lesion occurs in the left visual cortex below the calcacrine sulcus it results in upper right quadrantanopia and if it occurs above the calcarine sulcus it causes lower right quadrantanopia, same case goes if lesion occurs in the right visual cortex it will result in deficits of the left eye), hemiballismus due to infarction of the subthalamic nucleus from the lacunar branches of the posterior cerebral arteries, prosopagnosia (impaired recognition of familiar faces), third cranial nerve palsy with fixation of eye infero-laterally, fourth cranial nerve palsy with inability to move eye infero-medially.\n\n \u25cf Posterior inferior cerebral artery: a stroke originating from this artery causes ipsi-lateral ataxia and sensory deficit of the face, contra-lateral sensory impairment of the lateral spinothalamic tract (pain and temperature) of the upper and lower limbs with minimal motor deficit, dysphagia and ipsi-lateral loss of gag-reflex due to glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves paralysis, ischemia of the inferior vestibular nucleus leading to vertigo with horizontal nystagmus, and dysarthria. All these findings constitute signs and symptoms of lateral medullary syndrome otherwise known as wallenberg syndrome.\n\n \u25cf Anterior spinal artery: a stroke originating from this artery results in medial medullary syndrome which consists of contra-lateral upper and lower limb hemiparesis with impaired sensation of the dorsal column (vibration and proprioception), and ipsilateral hypoglossal deficit causing the tongue to deviate towards the site of the lesion.\n\n \u25cf Basilar artery: a stroke originating from this artery causes locked-in syndrome where the person affected is awake and unable to move or speak but their eyes are open, vertigo and vertical nystagmus due to involvement of the vestibular nuclei, palsies of cranial nerves III, IV, and VI leading to extra-occular movement dysfunction, and quadriplegia.\n\n \u25cf Lacunar syndromes: are signs and symptoms arising from the infarction of the deep arteries of the brain; pure sensory stroke which results from damage to the thalamus and presents as contra-lateral loss of sensory reception affecting the face and limbs, pure motor stroke results from damage to the internal capsule and presents with weakness or loss of motor function in the contra-lateral face and limbs, sensori-motor results from damage to the thalamus and internal capsule as it presents with motor and sensory deficits of the contra-lateral face and limbs, ataxic hemiparesis results from damage caused to the posterior limb of the internal capsule and pons and presents as ipsilateral ataxia of the upper and lower limbs associated with weakness of the limbs and vertical nystagmus, lastly is clumsy-hand syndrome which results from damage to the pons and presents with contra-lateral loss of control and weakness of the upper limb associated with inability to speak.\n\n\"",

The major chemicals of the central nervous system are Glutamate, GABA, Acetylcholine, Dopamine, Serotonin, Epinephrine, Norepinephrine, Enkephalin, and Endorphines.\n\n - Glutamate: known for being the excitatory chemical of the central nervous and being involved with almost all actions that require excitation. Glutamate is released by neurons upon excitation via an action potential for further propagation, glutamate would bind to its respective receptors depending on the site and the action required (see CNS Physiology - basics of receptors section).\n\n - GABA: gamma amino-butyric acid, is synthesized from glutamate by glutamate decarboxylase and is known for being the inhibitory chemical of the central nervous and is involved with almost all actions that require inhibition. GABA is released by neurons when ever an action of inhibition is required, and depending on the type of inhibitory action and site, it would bind to its respective receptors to generate a response.\n\n - Acetylcholine: synthesized from cholin and acetyl-coA by choline acetyl-transferase, it plays an excitatory role in the central nervous system where it functions in arousal, cognition, eye movement, and it shows minor contribution in memory processing and the basal ganglia pathways.\n\n - Dopamine: synthesized from L-phenylalanine which goes through a series of enzymatic changes where the final product is Dopamine, it functions in emotions, attentiveness, motivation, sexual pleasure, and most importantly movement as it is considered to be the main chemical of substantia nigra where it is found to be of the highest concentration thus giving it its black color. The lack of dopamine in the substantia nigra results in parkinson disease (see pathology of the CNS - degenerative pathologies).\n\n - Serotonin: is synthesized from L-tryptophan which goes through the processes of hyroxylation and decarboxyltion to result in Serotonin. Though it functions primarily in the gastro-intestinal tract, serotonin has been linked to mood status (dubbed the happiness hormone) since it showed depression at low levels and it also has been shown to regulate the intensity of signal transduction.\n\n - Epinephrine: is the chemical released during the fight or flight/stress situation. Released primarily from the adrenal medulla, epinephrine stimulates the sympathetic nervous system thus increases hear rate, respiratory rate, blood glucose levels, and causes pupil dilation. Epinephrine has also been proven to have a role in memory consolidation but the mechanism is yet to be fully determined.\n\n - Norepinephrine: secreted mainly from the pons, it functions in keeping the body and mind awake through increasing alertness, attentiveness, plays a role in memory retrieval and exhibits the other functions of epinephrine.\n\n - Enkephalin: is a protein that inhibits pain receptors primarily in the spinal cord and activates the opioid receptors in order to suppress pain, they have also been linked to lowering stress levels.\n\n - Endorphins: act to inhibit pain signals primarily in the brain, they also relieve stress and decrease alertness by acting as stimulatory agents to the body's opioid receptors.\n\n \u2713 Both Enkephalins and Endorphines act on decreasing pain but Endorphins have shown a stronger affinity and efficacy towards the opioid receptors.\n\n\"",

Between the cornea and iris lies the anterior chamber, a space filled with the aqueous humor of the eye.\n\n - Vascular part of the eye:\n \u2022 Iris: is the colored and movable part of the eye, its shows an opening at its center called the pupil.\n\n \u2022 Ciliary body: is an anterior extension of the eye's choroid (the innermost part of the eye's vascular compartment), it consists of the ciliary muscle which will be discussed along with the muscles and the ciliary processes. The ciliary processes are nothing more than projections arising from the ciliary body downward and they are seen to be falling in line with the lens, the processes contribute in the production of the aqueous humor of the eye, they also give off thin fibers called zonular fibers that attach to the lens keeping it in place (these zonular fibers form the suspensory ligament of the eye).\n\n \u2022 Choroid: a highly vascular structure that is seen to be circulating the eyeball, from the ciliary body at one pole and to the ciliary body of the other pole. The choroid is attached to the retina along its entire course, it is also attached to the sclera.\n\n - Inner part of the eyeball: consists of the vitreous chamber ( a space filled with aqueous humor), the retina, the optic disc, the macula lutea, the fovea centralis and the blood vessels.\n\n \u25cf Vitreous chamber: it is a space filled with a gel-like substance called the vitreous fluid, it gives the eye its rounded shape, aid in lens lubrication and is a shock absorber that maintains the integrity of the retina.\n\n \u25cf Retina: as the optic nerve enters the eyeball through the optic disc, it divides into two nerve fibers and both are running along the choroid to the ciliary body and iris at both poles. The retinal fibers covering the ciliary body and iris are known to be non-visual fibers and those that are running along the choroid are considered to be the visual fibers and are called the optic part of the retina. Although the non-visual part is a continuation of the visual fibers but those two types of fibers fortunately do not blend but are separated by a well demarcated line called the ora serrata just before the ciliary body.\n\n \u25cf Optic disc: is the opening of the eyeball where structures shall enter the eye, while in ophthalmoscopy it is seen as a yellow circle with a well defined round border.\n\n \u25cf Macula lutea and fovea centralis: the macula is located to the lateral side of the optic disc, a dark colored patch with an even darker center called the fovea. This structure shows the highest sensitivity to light and color than other parts of the retina.\n\n \u2713 The muscles of the eye are divided into external muscles that are involved in eye movement and internal muscles that dilate and constrict the lens.\n\n - External muscles:\n \u25cf Superior rectus: originates from a circular ligament called the common tendinous ring located in the orbit and circles the optic canal. It ends in the anterior half of the eyeball, this muscle moves the eye upward and outward and is innervated by the oculomotor nerve.\n\n \u25cf Inferior rectus: Originates from a circular ligament called the common tendinous ring located in the orbit and circles the optic canal. It ends in the anterior half of the eyeball, this muscle moves the eye downward and outward and is innervated by the oculomotor nerve.\n\n \u25cf Medial rectus: originates from a circular ligament called the common tendinous ring located in the orbit and circles the optic canal. It ends in the anterior half of the eyeball, moves the eye inward/medially in a horizontal plane and is innervated by the oculomotor nerve.\n\n \u25cf Lateral rectus: originates from a circular ligament called the common tendinous ring located in the orbit and circles the optic canal. It ends in the anterior half of the eyeball, moves the eye outward/laterally in a horizontal plane and is innervated by the abducent nerve.\n\n \u25cf Superior oblique: originates from the body of sphenoid superior to the optic canal with in the orbit and ends on the superior surface of the eyeball, it moves the eye downward and inward and is innervated by the trochlear nerve.\n\n \u25cf Inferior rectus: originates from the maxilla at the floor of the orbit and ends on the lower surface of the eyeball, it moves the eye upward and inward and is innervated by the oculomotor nerve.\n\n - Intrinsic muscles of the eye:\n \u25cf Sphincter pupillae: located in the iris, this group of muscles fall in circular arrangement with one another, they constrict the pupil upon contraction and receive parasympathetic stimulation from the oculomotor nerve.\n\n \u25cf Dilator papillae: located in the iris, this group of muscles fall in radial arrangement with one another, they dilate the pupil upon contraction and receive sympathetic stimulation from the long ciliary nerve that originates from the superior cervical ganglion.\n\n - Optical blood supply of the eyeball:\n \u25cf Central retinal artery: a branch of the ophthalmic artery, enters the eyeball through the optic disc and gives off the superior and inferior macular arterioles (supply the macula), superior nasal and temporal retinal arterioles (supply superior nasal and temporal retina), inferior nasal and temporal retinal arterioles (supply inferior nasal and temporal retina).\n\n \u25cf Short posterior ciliary arteries: originates from the ophthalmic artery and as they are running along the sides of the optic nerve they pierce into the sclera (supply sclera) to terminate in the choroid of the eye. These arteries are significant in a way that they supply the optic disc by forming a circular body of blood vessels around it, called the circle of zinn and haller.\n\n \u25cf Long posterior ciliary arteries: originated from the ophthalmic artery, these arteries enter the sclera (supply sclera) at the medial and lateral sides of the posterior surface of the eyeball and continue between the sclera and choroid (supply choroid) to the ciliary body (supply ciliary muscles), they also send off branches to the iris to form the circulus arteriousus major (circular body of blood veesels made around the inner rim of the iris; supply the iris).\n\n \u25cf Anterior ciliary arteries: originated from the ophthalmic artery, they run along the outer surface of the eyeball (supplying the rectus muscles) to the front of the eye (supply the conjuctiva) where they pierce the sclera (supply sclera) and enter the eyeball.\n\n\"",

The basal cells are responsible for regeneration of the cells of the olfactory system.\n\n - Transduction of olfaction:\n \u25cf The cilia binds the odorant molecule, this binding activates the olfactory receptors.\n\n \u25cf The olfactory receptors are G-protein coupled receptors and so when activated, they result in up-regulation of adenylyl cyclase which in turn causes over-expression of cAMP. The increase in cAMP causes the ion channels to open allowing the influx of sodium and calcium in the cell thus an action potential is generated.\n\n \u25cf The action potential is carried along the olfactory nerve axons of the olfactory receptors upward through the ciribriform plate where it synapses with the axons of the mitral cells at the glomerulus of the olfactry system (in the olfacotry bulb).\n\n \u25cf The mitral axons run through the mitral cells and exit as the olfactory nerve fibers.\n\n \u25cf The olfactory nerve fibers continue into the cerebrum to reach the olfactory cortex of the temporal lobe and the limbic system where it is processed.\n\n\"",
      "\"description_acid_base_resp\" : \"\n A change in the body PH can be due to acidosis or alkalosis, acidosis is a state of increased hydrogen protons and CO2 in the body and can either be respiratory or metabolic in origin and alkalosis is a state of decreased CO2 in the body that can have a respiratory or metabolic origin, this section will hold the discussion respiratory acidosis and alkalosis.\n\n Due to an underlying pathological condition of the lungs, the central respiratory center, or a neuromuscular condition affecting the nerves and muscles of respiration where the lungs aren't able to function properly and expel the CO2 in the body resulting in the build up of CO2 (increased CO2 partial pressure).\n\n Since the majority of CO2 is carried as a modified compound (see physiology of respiration - gas transport section), the hydrogen ions produced as an end result of the chemical reaction further accumulate, this puts the body into a state of acidosis with a PH lower than 7.35.\n\n Despite the increase in acidity, the PH might remain normal or slightly decreased, however if respiratory acidosis were to take a longer duration, this elicits a compensatory mechanism where there is a counteract increase of bicarbonate in response to the acidosis, this increase in bicarbonate is called compensated respiratory acidosis. The compensation occurs by the kidneys where there will be excretion of acid and re-absorption of bicarbonate.\n\n Respiratory alkalosis occurs with any underlying condition that cause hyperventilation, the rapid respiratory rate brings in more oxygen and expels more CO2 in turn, as with CO2 partial pressure decreased and less hydrogen protons this puts the body in a state of alkalosis with a PH higher than 7.45.\n\n In alkalosis, the body detaches the hydrogen protons from its buffers such as deoxyhemoglobin to counteract the alkalosis but when the body remains in an alkaline status for a long duration of time the kidneys compensate by decreasing hydrogen proton secretion and increasing bicarbonate excretion, this is called compensated respiratory alkalosis.\n\n\"",

      "\"description_distal_convoluted_tubule\" : \"\n The distal convoluted tubule lies at the cortical region of the kidney and is described as early and late distal convoluted tubule with each part equipped with distinct function.\n\n - early distal convoluted tubule: is concerned with the absorption of sodium and chloride but is impermeable to water and the process by which is does the absorption involves a co-transporter. the luminal part of the tubule is equipped with a Na+ and Cl- co-transporter whose energy is generated via the Na-K ATPase counter-pump located at the basolateral membrane enabling both elements to pass through the lumen together. the sodium entering the cell leaves the cell via the Na-K ATPase counter pump while potassium leaving the blood and entering the cell but as for the chloride ion it diffuses passively across the basolateral membrane and into the blood.\n\n - late distal convoluted tubule: unlike the early distal convoluted tubule, this tubule is different in that it absorbs sodium by the process of diffusion where sodium passes through the lumen and into the cell passively through non-gated sodium channels down the electrochemical gradient generated by the Na-K ATPase pump at the basolateral membrane, it also has a non-gated potassium channel on the lumen where postassium entering the cell from the basolateral surface leaves into the lumen through this channel. this part of the tubule is also permeable to water, however water reabsorption is modulatd hormonally by aldosterone.\n\n these tubules also have acid-base regulating channels equipped onto special cells called intercalated cells; type one intercalated cells are equipped with a hydrogen-potassium ATPase counter-pump at the lumen membrane where the hydrogen proton is excreted out of the cell in exchange of potassium, it also has a non-gated bicarbonate channel at the basolateral membrane that allows bicarbonate to diffuse into the blood, the hydrogen and bicarbonate are a result of CO2 and H20 binding together to form carbonic acid which is then dissociated within the cell by the enzyme carbonic anhydrase into a hydrogen proton and bicarbonate. type two intercalated cells counteract the function of type one intercalated cells as it is equipped with non-gated bicarbonate channels at its lumen membrane in order to excrete excess bicarbonate from the circulation and is also equipped with hydrogen pumps at the basolateral membrane to absorb hydrogen when there is a state of hydrogen depletion in the circulation.\n\n\"",
      "\"description_ventricles_brain\" : \"\n The ventricles are fluid-filled communicating spaces lined by ependyma and are filled with CSF.\n\n the brain has four ventricles; two lateral ventricles (communicate with the third ventricle by the interventricular foramina), the third ventricle and the fourth ventricle (the third ventricle communicates with the fourth ventricle by the cerebral aqueduct). the fourth ventricle is continuous with the central canal of the spinal cord and is also continuous with the subarachnoid space by the three foramina in its roof.\n\n - Lateral ventricles: they are divided into a body which lies in the parietal lobe, the body shows three extensions, the anterior horn which lies in the frontal lobe, the posterior horn which lies in the occipital lobe, and the inferior horn which lies in the temporal lobe.\n\n \u25cf Body of the lateral ventricle: extends from the interventricular foramen posteriorly to the posterior end of the thalamus and it consists of a roof that is formed by the undersurface of the corpus callosum, the floor that is formed by the body of the caudate nucleus and the lateral margin of the thalamus, and the medial wall that is formed by the septum pellucidum at its anterior part and the posterior part is formed by the roof and the floor coming together. The choroid plexus (produce CSF) enters the body of the lateral ventricle through the choroidal fissure which lies between the body of the fornix and the superior surface of the thalamus, its blood vessels pass to the ependyma and the pia mater of the tela choroidea of the lateral venticle.\n\n \u25cf Anterior horn of the lateral ventricle: it is continuous with the body of the ventricle at the interventricular formen posteriorly, and consists of a roof that is formed by the undersurface of the anterior part of the corpus callosum (anterior horn is limited anteriorly by the genu of the corpus callosum), the floor that is formed by the head of the caudate nucleus (a small portion of the medial part of the floor is formed by the superior surface of the rostrum of the corpus callosum) the medial wall that is formed by the septum pellucidum and the anterior column of the fornix.\n\n \u25cf Posterior horn of the lateral ventricle: consists of the roof, lateral wall and medial wall. the roof and the lateral wall are formed by fibers of the tapetum of the corpus callosum (the optic radiation lies lateral to the tapetum). The medial wall shows a superior swelling (bulb of the posterior horn) formed by the forceps major (fibers of the corpus callosum) and pass posteriorly to the occipital lobe, the inferior swelling (calcar avis) formed by the calcarine sulcus.\n\n \u25cf Inferior horn of the lateral ventricle: consists of a roof that is formed by the inferior surface of the tapetum of the corpus callosum and the tail of the caudate nucleus, the floor that is formed laterally by the collateral eminence (collateral eminence is produced by the collateral fissure) and medially by the hippocampus. The hippocampus shows an anterior expansion called the pes hippocampus, although the hippocampus is composed of gray matter is ventricular surface is covered by a layer of white matter called the alveus and it is formed by axons of the hippocampus that unite at the medial side of the hippocampus to form the fimbria which eventually becomes continuous posteriorly with the posterior column of the fornix.\n\n - Third ventricle: is a slit-like space that lies between the two thalami, and communicating anteriorly with the lateral ventricles through the IV formen and posteriorly with the fourth ventricle through the cerebral aqueduct. Lined by ependyma, the third ventricle consists of superior, inferior, posterior, anterior and lateral walls.\n\n \u25cf Superior wall of the third ventricle: lined by ependyma, where superior to the ependyma lies the tela choroidea of the third ventricle (formed by pia mater) and within the tela choroidea are the internal cerebral arteries. The superior wall is also realted to the fornix and the corpus callosum.\n\n \u25cf Inferior wall of the third ventricle: it is formed by the optic chiasma, tuber cinereum, infundibulum, the mammillary bodies with the tegmentum of the cerebral peduncles lying posterior to these structures.\n\n \u25cf Posterior wall of the third ventricle: it is formed by the cerebral aqueduct but speaking from a bigger picture we will talk about the relations superior to the cerebral aqueduct. Superior to the cerebral aqueduct is the posterior commissure, and superiorto that is the pineal recess which gives off the pineal stalk, and superior to the pineal recess lies the habenular commisure.\n\n \u25cf Anterior wall of the third ventricle: formed by the lamina terminalis (a sheet of gray matter), the anterior commisure (bundle of nerve fibers) runs across the lamina terminalis and it lies anterior to the anterior columns of the fornix (connects the right and left temporal lobes)\n\n \u25cf Lateral wall of the third ventricle: its is formed superiorly by the medial surface of the thalamus and inferiorly by the hypothalamus with the hypothalamic sulcus running in between and separating the two layers. superiorly, the lateral wall is limited by the stria medullaris thalami and the two lateral walls are connected to one another by the interthalamic nuclei.\n\n - The fourth ventricle: it is a cavity that lies posterior to the pons and the upper half of the medulla oblongata and it also lies anterior to the cerebellum, it consists a roof, floor and lateral boundaries.\n\n \u25cf Roof of the fourth ventricle: as it projects into the cerebellum, the roof is divided into a superior part which is formed by the medial borders of both superior peduncles and the superior medullary velum (a sheet of white matter that extends and connects the superior cerebellar peduncles), and the inferior part of the roof which is formed by the inferior medullary velum. Inferior part of the roof shows the foramen of magendie (an opening that lies at the midline). The roof also shows lateral recesses that extend laterally to the sides of the medulla and form an opening anteriorly called foramina of luschka, these foramens form a communication between the fourth ventricle and the subarachnoid space, thus allowing CSF to flow from the ventricles to the subarachnoid space.\n\n \u25cf Floor of the fourth ventricle: formed by the posterior aspect of the pons and the upper half of the medulla oblongata. The floor shows a line that runs horizontally along the median plane called the median sulcus which divides the floor into two halves, on each side of the medial sulcus shows an elevation called the medial eminence which lateral to it lies the sulcus terminalis, lateral to the sulcus limitans is the vestibular area beneath which lies the vestibular nuclei, at the upper end of the sulcus limitans lies the substantia ferruginea (a blue-gray area consists of neurons containing melanin pigment), the inferior part of the medial eminence also shows an elevation called the facial colliculus (produced by the motor nucleus of the facial nerve). Below the level of the facial colliculus, strands of nerve fibers emerge from the median sulcus called the stria medullaris (arise from arcuate nuclei) and extend laterally and enter the cerebellum through the inferior cerebellar peduncle. Inferior to the stria medullaris, medially lies the hypoglossal triangle under which lies the hypoglossal nucleus and lateral to the hypoglossal triangle lies the vagal triangle under which lies the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve, lateral tot he vagal triangle lies the lower part of the vestibular area.\n\n The choroid plexus in the fourth ventricle just like the other ventricles is formed by the tela choroidea. The choroid plexus has a folded surface and each fold contains a vascular connective tissue core covered by cuboidal epithelium of the ependyma which is lined by micro-villi. Blood capillaries are separated from the ventricular lumen by three layers; the endothelium, the basement membrane, and the surface cuboidal (the epithelial cells are fenestrated and thus are permeable to large molecules). CSF is actively and constantly secreted which explains why the level of inorganic salts is lower than that of the blood plasma and that the CSF is secreted regardless of difference in pressure gradient (unlike blood plasma).\n\n - Lateral boundaries of the fourth ventrilce: it consists of upper lateral boundary formed by the superior cerebellar peduncle and the inferior lateral boundary formed by the inferior cerebellar peduncle.\n\n Cerebrospinal fluid: it occupies the ventricles of the brain, the subarachnoid space of the brain and spinal cord. The fluid is produced by the choroid plexus of the ventricles at a rate of 0.5ml/minute, a total volume of 150mL, with a clear and colorless appearance. CSF composition constitutes of protein, glucose and chloride.\n\n - Functions of the cerebrospinal fluid: it nourishes the CNS, removes products of neuronal metabolism, provides mechanical support for the brain, cushions and protects the CNS, serve as a reservoir and assists in the regulation of skull contents, and provides a pathway where pineal secretions pass and reach the pituitary gland.\n\n Circulation of cerebrospinal fluid: once it is secreted from the choroid plexus in the ventricles, the fluid moves in a descending pattern, from the lateral ventricles through the interventricular foramen to the third ventricle, then through the cerebral aqueduct into the fourth ventricle, from the fourth ventricle into the foramen of magendie and the lateral foramina of the lateral recesses of the fourth ventricle entering the subarachnoid space, it then enters through the cerebellomedullary cistern and pontine cistern and flowing superiorly into the tentorial notch of the tentorium cerebelli to reach the inferior surface of the cerebrum. From the inferior surface of the cerebrum, the fluid then moves superiorly over the lateral aspect of the cerebral hemispheres and some of the fluid moves to the subarachnoid space of the spinal cord and cauda equina.\n\n Please note movement of the CSF in the ventricles is aided by arterial pulsations of the choroid plexuses and the cilia lining the ependymal cells. Thus for the CSF to move superiorly over the lateral aspect of the cerebral hemispheres its movement is aided by the pulsations of the cerebral arteries.\n\n Absorption of the cerebrospinal fluid: it is absorbed by the arachnoid villi that are projecting into the dural venous sinuses and most evident and numerous in the superior sagittal sinus. Absorption of the CSF happens when the its pressure exceeds the pressure in the venous sinus. When the venous pressure rises above the CSF pressure, the tips of the villi are compressed, rendering closure of tubules and preventing reflux of blood into the subarachnoid space.\n\n Blood brain barrier: a group of structures separating the lumen of the blood vessels of the brain from the extracellular space that lies around the neurons and neuroglia. These structures are the endothelial cells of the capillary walls, the basement membrane under the endothelial cells, and the foot processes of the astrocytes adhering to the outer surface of the capillary walls. The endothelial cells exhibit tight junctions that prohibit the passage of most elements (like plasma proteins and large organic molecules) other than water and gasses (pass readily) and glucose and electrolytes (pass slowly), and these tight junction are responsible for the selective action of the blood-brain barrier. Furthermore, the blood-brain barrier is composed of a lipid bilayer allowing lipophilic molecules to pass readily through the barrier.\n\n \u2713 The entire CNS is covered with the blood brain barrier except the pineal gland, posterior lobe of the pituitary gland the tuber cinereum, the wall of the optic recess, the vascular area postrema at the lower end of the fourth ventricle (postrema; area of the medulla situated on the floor of the fourth ventricle behind the opening into the central canal).\n\n Blood-CSF barrier: a group of structure separating the lumen of the blood capillaries from the lumen of the ventricle (as CSF is produced in the ventricles). These structures are fenestrated endothelial cells (not truly fenestrated but are filled with a diaphragm that provides molecular selectivity), a basement membrane below the endothelian cells, scattered cels with flat processes, another basement membrane, the choroidal epithelial cells (these layers are arranged in a way where the lumen's endothelial cells are deepest and choroidal endothelial cells are most superficial). The tight junctions between the choroidal epithelial cells are the ones that form the barrier.\n\n\"",

      "\"description_acute_renal_patho\" : \"\n Acute kidney injury is a condition characterized by a short and rapid onset of kidney injury results in decreased urine output (less than 0.5/mL/kg/hr and/or less than 800mL/day) thus a decrease in glomerular filtration rate and an increase in serum creatinine and urea. Causes of acute kidney injury can be categorized as pre-renal (blood supply) , renal (parenchymal injury), post-renal (urinary outflow tract).\n\n - Pre-renal causes:\n \u25cf Hypo-perfusion: this condition is one of the two major causes of pre-renal kidney injury and is caused by blood or volume loss through hemorrhage or volume-depleting gastroenteritis. Other causes such as cardiac insufficiency (infarction and cardiomyopathy) and renal artery stenosis can disrupt blood flow to the kidney. This condition is diagnosed by hydration assessment and urinalysis and is managed by treatment directed towards the underlying cause.\n\n - Renal causes:\n \u25cf acute tubular necrosis: a condition characterized by the necrosis renal tubules as a consequence of hypovolemia or toxins that induce death such as gold, murcery, and lead. It results in acutd loss of kidney function evidenced by the increasing blood levels of urea and creatinine and presents with progressive decrease in urine output along with the presence of brown casts in urine (sloughing of dead tubular tissue), and hyperkalemia (decreased excretion due to renal impairment) and metabolic acidosis (potassium impairs ammonia excretion through collecting duct). This condition is diagnosed by urine analysis, BUN, creatinine, and urine microscopic examination. Management of this condition includes treatment directed towards the underlying cause.\n\n \u25cf Acute papillary necrosis: a condition characterized by necrosis renal papilla as a result of decrease perfusion of the renal medulla caused by sickle cell disease (increased viscosity and decreased blood flow), diabetes (damage of micro-vasculature), pyelonephritis (exudative stress), and chronic use of NSAIDS.

Management of this condition includes treatment directed towards the underlying cause.\n\n \u25cf Acute interstitial nephritis: a condition characterized by non-necrotizing inflammation of the renal tubules, a consequence of the long term use of provoking agents such as NSAIDS, an autoimmune reaction (goodpasture syndrome), and allergy from certain medications (penicillin; shows eosinophils in urine). It presents with fever, rash, oliguria, and hematuria (late stage). This condition is diagnosed by kidney biopsy and management of this condition includes treatment directed towards the underlying cause and cessation of offending agent.\n\n - Post-renal causes:\n \u25cf Urinary outflow obstruction: is a spectrum of abnormalities that disrupt urine outflow from the kidneys, ureter, or bladder. The obstruction can be due to a cyst, stone, tumor, bladder neck contracture, or prostatic hyperplasia. It presents with oliguria, urgency, weak urine stream, difficulty initaiting stream, and Peripheral edema from fluid retention. This condition is diagnosed by blood tests for BUN, creatinine, Urinalysis, and microscopic examination of urine along with CT-KUB to look for stones. Management of this condition includes treatment directed towards the underlying cause.\n\n \u2713 Stones in the urinary outflow tract with less than or equal to 4mm in diameter will pass through the tract while those greater than 6cm will require lithotripsy.\n\n\"",
      "\"description_salivary_secretions\" : \"\n Saliva is secreted from four gland in the oral cavity, the parotid gland (serous saliva), the sublingual and submandibular glands (both serous and mucus saliva), and the buccal gland (mucus saliva).\n\n - Phases of salivary secretions:\n \u25cf Acinary phase: the acini of the glands which are the secretory cells, release a substance that is identical in electrolyte composition to the plasma but differs from the latter in that it contains enzymes. The fluid released from the acini is isotonic in nature holding with in it sodium, chloride, potassium, and bicarbonate.\n\n \u25cf Ductal phase: is the exchange compartment where the fluid secreted from the acini flows into a duct-like structure called the salivary duct which modifies the saliva into its final form and release it to the oral cavity. The ductal cells contain exchange channels that modify the electrolyte composition of the saliva; the sodium ions are carried out of the salivary fluid in exchange for potassium through the ductal cells, the chloride is carried out of the salivary fluid through passive channels and in exchange for bicarbonate through ductal cells, and regardless of the chloride-bicarbonate exchange rate, more bicarbonate is being passively added into the salivary fluid (while sodium and chloride being extensively removed) resulting in a hypotonic solution.\n\n - Other contents of the saliva:\n \u25cf Alpha-amylase: functions in the initial process of carbohydrate digestion where it hydrolyzes starch into monosaccharides by bringing the alpha-1,4 glycosidic bonds.\n\n \u25cf Lingual lipase: functions in the initial phase of lipid digestion where it breaks down the triglyceride bonds into di-acyl-glycerol and free fatty acids, however this process only starts in the acidic environment of the stomach.\n\n \u25cf Salivary peroxidase: functions in neutralizing hydrogen peroxide which is carcinogenic free radical.\n\n \u25cf Hypothiocyanite: salivary peroxidase catalyzes the conversion of thiocyanite into hypothiocynaite, an anti-microbial compound responsible for maintaining the balance of the oral flora.\n\n \u25cf IgA: a potent immunoglobulin that prevents bacterial offense and growth in the oral cavity.\n\n \u25cf Satherines and proline rich proteins: function in neutralizing large amounts of calcium phosphate and prevention the aggregation of the latter and its associated crystal formation.\n\n \u25cf Mucin: a product of the sublingual and submandibular glands, functions in lubrication and pathogen entrapment.\n\n \u25cf Lysozume: an anti-microbial enzyme that functions in the breakdown of bacterial glycoprotein by hydrolyzing the beta-1,4 bonds of the pathogen's peptidoglycan present in the cell wall.\n\n - Stimulation of salivary secretion: saliva is constantly secreted by the glands however there are three factors that increase its production. When blood flow to the glands increase this means more plasma is being delivered and filtered from the vascular compartment to the acini, hence more blood flow means more salivary secretions. The sympathetic system also functions in increasing saliva production as when activated, norepinephrine binds to the beta-adrenergic receptors of the glands activating adenylyl cyclase and upregulating cyclic AMP which results in the acini cells producing more saliva. The parasympathetic system also functions in the overproduction of saliva as once activated acetylcholine binds to the muscarinic receptors resulting in the upregulation of calcium and IP3 which stimulates the acini to produce more saliva.\n\n \u2713 An increase in the salivary production rate (normal is 0.37ml/min) disrupts the normal tonicity of the saliva. An increase in production means that the salivary fluid will flow through the salivary ducts rapidly thus won't have enough time for the proper exchange of electrolytes.\n\n\"",

      "\"description_small_intestine_patho\" : \"\n - Celiac disease: is an inherited autoimmune condition with unknown pattern of inheritance (but affected individuals demonstrate HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 alleles) characterized by hypersensitivity to gluten peptides. The gluten-derived protein gliadin forms the basis of celiac disease pathophysiology where it activates a lymphocyte-mediated response against itself. This immune response results in flattening of the intestinal villi with lymphocytic proliferation and crypt hyperplasia as evidenced with biopsy. It presents with abdominal distention, diarrhea, and failure to thrive in the Pediatric population. This condition is diagnosed with biopsy and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody along with IgA levels. This condition is managed with gluten-free diet.\n\n - Crohn's disease: is a form of inflammatory bowel disease thought to be autoimmune-mediated but the direct pathophysiology is yet to be determined.

Once food is about to enter the pharynx, the chemical receptors surrounding the pharyngeal inlet send signals via the vagus and glossopharangeal nerves to the medulla to initiate the next stage of swallowing.\n\n \u25cf Pharyngeal stage of swallowing: is an involuntary stage, once edibles enter the pharynx the soft palate is pulled upwards to close the on the opening of the nasal cavity, the epiglottis is pulled upwards to close on the opening of the larynx/trachea, the palatopharyngeal folds contract towards one another forming a constricted pathway in the pharynx through which the edible descends, before reaching the upper esophageal sphincter the latter moves into a relaxed phase and the edible descends into the esophagus.\n\n \u25cf Esophageal stage: describes esophageal motility, once the food has entered the esophagus a first peristaltic wave is generated by the swallowing centers of the medulla and mediated via the vagus nerve and myenteric plexus. The peristaltic wave causes contraction of the space before the edible and dilation of the area in front of the edible for propulsion, then there is the second peristaltic wave which is generated in case the first wave wasn't able to apply a fore of propulsion strong enough for the descent of the edible to the lower esophagus. Before reaching the lower esophageal sphincter, an inhibitory impulse is generated by the myenteric plexus to relax the sphincter as well as the stomach so they both are able to expand and receive the edible.\n\n\"",

      "\"description_limbic_system\" : \"\n Reticular formation: is a network of neurons and axons that is present along the axis of the spinal cord to the brain. It receives sensory input from most sensory systems and possess efferent fibers that descend to affect neurons at all levels of the central nervous system. The reticular formation could influence level of consciousness, skeletal muscle activity, somatic and endocrine systems and autonomic and visceral sensations.\n\n Arrangement of reticular formation: it extends from the spinal cord to the medulla, pons, midnrain, subthalamus and hypothalamus. The reticular formation is divided into three longitudinal columns and each has a different set of neurons, the one in the median plane is the median column with neurons of intermediate size, the second one is the medial column with large sized neurons, the third one is the lateral column with small sized neurons.\n\n - Afferent fibers of reticular formation: they come from various positions in the CNS; the spinal cord with spinoreticular tract, spinothalamic tract and medial lemniscus, the cranial nerve nuclei (ascending afferent tracts) and they are the vestibular, acoustic and visual tracts, from the cerebellum is the cerebelloreticular tract. Fibers also come from the thalamic, subthalamic, hypothalamic nuclei, corpus striatum, limbic system, primary motor cortex of the frontal lobe and from the somesthetic cortex of the parietal lobe.\n\n - Efferent fibers of reticular formation: these fibers arise from many different positions in the CNS, they descend down the brainstem and spinal cord via the reticulobulbar and reticulospinal tracts to the neurons in the motor nuclei of the cranial nerves and the anterior horn cells of the spinal cord with the descending tracts extending to the sympathetic outflow and the craniosacral parasympathetic outflow of the autonomic nervous system. There are also fibers extending to the corpus striatum, cerebellum, red nucleus, substantia nigra, tectum, the nuclei of thalamus, subthalamus and hypothalamus. The cerebral cortex also receives the efferent fibers projecting from the reticular formation.\n\n - Functions of reticular formation:\n \u25cf Control skeletal muscles: it affects the activity of the alpha and gamma neurons via the reticulospinal and reticulobulbar tracts thereby modulating muscle tone and reflex activity, provides reciprocal inhibition (when flexor muscles contract, antagonistic extensor muscles relax), maintains the tone of antigravity muscles while standing through the vestibular apparatus of the inner ear and the vestibular spinal tract. It also controls muscles of facial expressions thar are associated with emotion.\n\n \u25cf Control somatic and visceral sensations: as it is centrally located in the cerebrospinal axis, it influences all ascending tracts passing to the supraspinal levels with either inhibitory or facilitative influences.\n\n \u25cf Control autonomic nervous system: via the reticulobulbar and reticulospinal tract, the impulses of autonomic control descend from the cerebrum, hypothalamus, and subcortical nuclei to the sympathetic outflow and parasympathetic craniosacral outflow.\n\n \u25cf Control hypophysis cerebri: can regulate hormonal balance directly or indirectly by influencing the release of hormone releasing and hormone inhibiting factors that are secereted by the hypophysis cerebri.\n\n - Limbic system: the structures involved in forming the limbic system are callosal gyrus, cingulate gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus, hippocampal formation, amygdaloid nucleus, mamillary bodies and the anterior thalamic nucleus.

The anterior part of the dentate gyrus continues into the uncus while its posterior part goes along with the fimbria almost to the splenium of the corpus callosum and becomes continuous with the indusium griseum which is a thin layer of gray matter covering the superior surface of the corpus callosum. The indusium griseum also show on its surface two bindles of white fibers called the medial and lateral striae which basically are remnants of the white matter of the indusium griseum.\n\n - Parahippocampal gyrus: lies between the hippocampal fissure and the collateral sulcus and is also continuous with the hippocampus along the medial edge of the temporal lobe. Amygdaloid nucleus will be explained in the basal ganglia chapter.\n\n - Connceting tracts of the limbic system:\n \u25cf Alveus: a thin layer of white matter that lies in the superior surface of the hippcampus, its axons originate in the hippocampal cortex and converge on the medial border of the hippocampus to form the fimbria.\n\n \u25cf Fimbria: the fimbria becomes the crus of the fornix as it leaves the posterior end of the hippocampus and the crus of the fornix curves posteriorly and superiorly below the splenium of the corpus callosum and around the posterior surface of the thalamus where it converge with is pair on the other side forming the body of the fornix. At the posterior side of the crura their bodies are not close to one another and therefore are connceted together via the commissure of the fornix which are transverexe decussating fibers that join the hippocampus of both sides. The body of the fornix is connected to the undersurface of the corpus callosum by the septum pellucidum. The body of the fornix is related to the tela choroidea and the ependymal roof of the third ventricle inferiorly.

The vibrations of the basilar membrane cause vibrations of the endolymph in the scala media and as a result the endolymph causes vibration of the organ of corti (lies in the scala media).\n\n \u25cf The organ of corti are hair cell structures that lie on the basilar membrane and exhibit cilia-like structures on their surface called stereo-cilia, the hair cells are divided into inner hair cells which are the ones that convert the mechanical energy in to neuro-chemical energy and generate the nerve impulses while the outer hair cells act to improve the frequency of sound so the inner cells could have pure frequencies to work with.\n\n \u25cf The upper part of the hair cells lies in contact with the tectorial membrane and once they start vibrating against the membrane they generate a force that causes cilia to open their ion channels.\n\n \u25cf Since the organ of corti lies in an environment rich in potasssium, potassium flows into the open ion channels of the stereo-cilia and this influx of potassium causes the opening of other ion channels at the base of the inner cells that allow calcium influx and the release of glutamate thus an action potential is generated.\n\n \u25cf The action potential generated travels along the spiral ganglion of corti (first order neurone of the cochlear nerve) and to the medulla where it synapses with the anterior and posterior cochlear nuclei (second order neuron of the cochlear nerve).\n\n \u25cf At this point, the nerve crosses to the contra-lateral side (with a small portion of fibers ascending ipsilaterally), the nerve continues to ascend where it synapses with the superior olivary nucleus of the pons and it then further ascends to synapse with the nucleus of lateral lemniscus.\n\n \u25cf From the nucleus of lateral lemniscus, the fibers ascend into the midbrain to the inferior colliculus and then further ascend to the medial geniculate body.\n\n \u25cf Then, from the medial geniculate body the fibers ascend into the auditory cortex of the temporal lobe.\n\n\"",

      "\"description_patho_wbc\" : \"\n - Leukocytosis: is a condition characterized by increased white cell count (normal range 4000-11000) indicating an ongoing infection. A high neutrophil count (normal range 40-60 percent) is suggestive of a bacterial infection, high eosinophil count (normal range 1-4 percent) is suggestive of a parasitic (Helminths) infection or an allergic reaction, a high basophil count (normal range 0.5-1 percent) indicates a chronic inflammation or malignant proliferation of white blood cells, a high monocyte count (normal range 2-8 percent) is suggestive of an autoimmune condition or ongoing recovery from an infection, and a high lymphocyte count (normal range 20-40 percent) is suggestive of an ongoing viral infection.\n\n - Acute myeloid leukemia: is a condition characterized by the malignant proliferation of myeloblast cells in the bone marrow occurring mostly in adults of old age and is of rapid progression. It results following a genetic translocation of the ETO gene on chromosome 8 to chromosome 21 and the translocation of the RUNX-1 gene on chromosome 21 to chromosome 8, such a genetic mutation (most common form of acute myeloid leukemia) is abbreviated T(8;21). The malignant proliferation increases myeloblast levels (immature white blood cells) resulting in overcrowding of other cell lineages, thus it presents with recurrent infections, anemia (iron deficiency symptoms), and increased tendency of bleeding and bruising, and skin nodules. This condition is diagnosed by peripheral blood smear and bone marrow biopsy showing hypercellularity with more than 20 percent myeloblasts (cells of abundant granular cytoplasm with characteristic Auer rods and basophilic nuclei with prominent nucleoli). Management of this condition includes chemotherapy with daunarubicin and cytosine arabinoside.\n\n - Acute lymphoblastic leukemia: is a condition characterized by the malignant proliferation of B-cell and T-cell lymphocytes in the bone marrow, mostly occurring in the pediatric population and is of rapid progression. It results following a genetic translocation of the ABL gene on chromosome 9 to chromosome 22 and the translocation of the BCR gene from chromosome 22 to chromosome 9, such a genetic mutation (mlst common form of acute lymphoblastic leukemia) is abbreviated as T(9;/22) and the newly formed chromosome is called the philadelphia chromosome. The malignant proliferation increases lymphocyte levels resulting in overcrowding of other cell lineages, thus it presents with recurrent infections, anemia (iron deficiency symptoms), and increased tendency of bleeding and bruising, unexplained fever, generalized bone pain, pain over the sternum when pressure is applied, weight loss, hepatosplenomegaly, anterior mediastinal mass (thymus gland enlargement), testicular leukemia, and lymphadenopathy. This condition is diagnosed by peripheral blood smear and bone marrow biopsy showing hypercellularity with more than 20 percent lymphoblasts (cells with scant cytoplasm with basophilic nuclei). Management of this condition includes vincristine, doxurubicine, methotrexate/cyclophosphamide , and prednisolone.\n\n - Chronic myeloid leukemia: is a condition characterized by the slow but malignant proliferation of myeloblasts in the bone marrow, exclusively occurring the adult population and is of slow progression. It results from the genetic mutation known as the Philadelphia chromosome. The malignant proliferation increases lymphocyte levels resulting in overcrowding of other cell lineages, thus it presents with recurrent infections, anemia (iron deficiency symptoms), and increased tendency of bleeding and bruising, unexplained fever, generalized bone pain, weight loss, hepatosplenomegaly, and lymphadenopathy. This condition is diagnosed by peripheral blood smear and bone marrow biopsy showing hypercellularity with a mixture of mature white blood cells (all types) and immature myeloblasts. Management of this condition includes Imatinib.\n\n - Chronic lymphocytic leukemia:is a condition characterized by the slow but malignant proliferation of B-cell lymphocytes in bone marrow, occurring mostly in late adulthood and is of slow progression. It results from the genetic mutation and deletion of the long arm of chromosome 13 and abbreviated as deletion 13q14. Affected individuals often appear asymptomatic but may show up with symptoms similar to chronic myeloid leukemia. This condition is often diagnosed incidentally, however the gold-standard diagnostic modalities are peripheral blood smear and bone marrow biopsy showing mature lymphocytes with scant basophilic cytoplasm, large nuclei and prominent nucleoli. Management of this condition includes ibrutinib, rituximab, fludarabine, and cyclophosphamide.\n\n - Multiple myeloma: is a condition characterized by malignant proliferation of plasma cells in the bone marrow resulting in high levels of IgA and IgG levels mediated via deletions occurring on chromosome 13. The elevated light-chain immunoglobulins create a characteristic form of protein known as Bence-Jones protein that is found un urine and blood. It presents with recurrent infections, anemia, generalized bone pain, and renal failure. This condition is diagnosed by blood X-ray showing hypodense, round, well-circumscribed lytic lesions, Urinalysis (showing Bence-Jones protein), peripheral blood smear (characteristic rouleaux formation; stacking of RBCs), and bone marrow biopsy showing multi-nucleated mature and immature plasma cells with abundant granular cytoplasm and large polymorphic nuclei. Management of this condition includes pamidronate, thalidomode, dexamethasone , and daratumumab.\n\n\"",
      "\"description_esophagus_patho\" : \"\n -Barret esophagus: is the metaplastic conversion of the esophageal squamous epithelium to columnar epithelium as a result of constant irritation of the esophagus. This condition can eventually progress to adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. No specific symptoms can be established for barret esophagus but those presenting with prolonged heartburn are susceptible to developing the disease. This condition is diagnosed by endoscopy which shows the color variation of the esophageal lining with metaplastic cells being dark red. This condition is managed by omeprazole, close follow-up, and surgical resection of metaplastic cells.\n\n - Gastro-esophageal reflux: is a condition characterized by retrograde flow of gastric acid and contents into the esophagus causing heartburn.

In the head of the pancreas the main pancreatic duct would give off a minor tube called the accessory pancreatic duct which opens at the first part of the descending duodenum through the minor duodenal papilla, however, the main duct then further descends with the head of the pancreas to level with the last part of the descending duodenum where it unites with the bile duct and form the hepatopancreatic ampulla/duct (within the head of the pancreas) which opens into the last part of the descending duodenum through the major duodenal papilla.\n\n - Blood supply of the pancreas:\n \u25cf Superior pancreaticoduodenal artery: is a branch of the gastroduodenal artery which is a branch of the common hepatic artery that originates from the celiac trunk, it supplies the superior head of the pancreas.\n\n \u25cf Inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery: which is a branch of the superior mesenteric artery, it further divides into an anterior and posterior arterial branches and supplies the inferior part of the head of the pancreas (anterior and posterior surfaces).\n\n \u25cf Splenic artery: a branch of the celiac trunk that runs along the superior border of the pancreas to reach the spleen giving off numerous pancreatic branches along its course supplying the body and tail of the pancreas.\n\n \u25cf Greater pancreatic artery: is a branch of the splenic artery that supplies the tail and distal half of the body of the pancreas.\n\n \u25cf Posterior pancreatic artery: a branch of the splenic artery that arises from the proximal part of the splenic artery posterior to the neck of the pancreas and runs along the posterior surface of the pancreas to reach the tail, it supplies the neck, body, and tail of the pancreas.\n\n \u2713 The pancreas in considered to tbe a retroperitoneal structure.\n\n\"",
      "\"description_pancreatic_secretions\" : \"\n The pancreas is an endocrine gland and an exocrine gland with the exocrine part of the pancreas being involved in digestion. Secretions of the pancreas occurs in the same fashion as those of salivary glands but with a slight modification, the pancreas contains three types of secretory cells unlike the salivary glands which contain two.\n\n - Phases of pancreatic secretion:\n \u25cf Acinary phase: the acini of the pancreatic glands are the enzymatic secretory cells that only secrete pancreatic enzymes without the accompanied pancreatic juice. The enzymes are manufactured within the rough endoplasmic reticulum of the acinar cells and stored in vesicles to then be released via exocytosis upon stimulation. The pancreatic enzymes secreted by the acini are amylase, lipase, colipase, trypsinogen (inactive; active form is trypsin), chyomptrypsinogen (inactive; active form is chymotrypsin), cholesterol ester hydrolase, and procarboxypeptidase (inactive; active form is carboxypeptidase).\n\n \u25cf Centro-acinary phase: the centro-acinar cells are located between the acinar and duct cells typically forming the border between the two different cell types, the centro-acinar cells secrete an isotonic fluid rich in water, sodium, and potassium with minimal bicarbonate and chloride.\n\n \u25cf Ductal phase: the enzymes and the minimal isotonic fluid secreted by the acini and centro-acini pass into the ducts where the duct cells release the majority of isotonic fluid and provide modification of the electrolytes. Water flows passively into the duct's lumen and sodium flows from within the lumen to the blood through the intercellular spaces of the duct cells, the major change occurring in the ducts is that more bicarbonate is being added. When CO2 and water within the duct cells they produce carbonic enzyme through a reaction catalyzed by carbonic anhydrase, the carbonic acid splits into a hydrogen proton and bicarbonate, the hydrogen proton is then sent into the blood via a hydrogen-sodium pump and the bicarbonate is released into the lumen for chloride via a chloride-bicarbonate exchange pump.\n\n - Factors stimulating the release of pancreatic secretion:\n \u25cf CCK: released from I-cells of the small intestine it stimulates the acinar cells to release pancreatic enzymes by binding to the CCKA receptors of the acinar cells resulting in upregulation of IP3 and calcium and the release of enzymes. It also act on the G-protein coupled receptors of the centro-acinar and duct cells activating adenylyl cyclase resulting in the up-regulation of cyclic AMP and secretion of the pancreatic fluid.\n\n \u25cf Secretin: act predominantly on the G-protein coupled receptors of the duct cells activating adenylyl cyclase resulting in the up-regulation of cyclic AMP and secretion of the pancreatic fluid.\n\n \u25cf Parasympathetic nervous system: the vagus nerve stimulates the submucousal plexus to release acetylcholine which binds to the muscarinic receptors of the acinar and centroacinar cells for the release of pancreatic fluid.\n\n\"",

Although it lies within proximity to the limbic system, the thalamus, ascending and descending tracts and the hypophysis, the hypothalamus is shown to have a relationship anteriorly with the optic chiasma and posteriorly with the tuber cinereum, the infundibulum and the mammillary bodies.\n\n - Optic chiasma: a bundle of nerve fibers that lie at the junction of the anterior wall and floor of the third ventricle. Superiorly it is continuous with the lamina terminalis and is related inferiorly to the hypophysis cerebri (the optic chiasma is sparated from the hypophysis cerebri by the diaphragma sellae).

The main female androgens are leutinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), progesterone, and estrogen.\n\n - Synthesis of leutinizing hormone: secreted from the gonadotropes of the anterior pituitary gland. The hypothalamus releases its gonadotropin releasing hormone which binds on to the G-protein coupled receptors of the gonadotropic cells of anterior pituitary gland. Once activated, those receptors then up-regulate phospholipase-C which breaksdown PIP-2 into di-acyl-glycerol and IP-3 resulting in the overexpression of protien kinase-C and increased calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum respectively. The end result of this intra-cellular reaction cascade is the release of leutinizing hormone from the anterior pituitary gland.\n\n - Mechanism of action of leutinizing hormone: it exerts it function by binding on to the G-coupled receptors of its designated target organs where the alpha subunit of the receptor would then activate adenylyl cyclase which up-regulates cAMP which activates protein kinase-A eventually resulting in phosphorylation and enabling leutinizing hormone to exert its desired effect on the target organ.\n\n - Function of leutinizing hormone:\n \u25cf It stimulates the development of the corpus luteum..\n \u25cf Plays a vital role in the female menstrual cycle.\n \u25cf Stimulates the process of ovulation which is the expulsion of the ovum from the follicle once it has matured.\n\n - Synthesis of follicle stimulating hormone: secreted from the gonadotropes of the anterior pituitary gland. The hypothalamus releases its gonadotropin releasing hormone which binds on to the G-protein coupled receptors of the gonadotropic cells of anterior pituitary gland. once activated, those receptors then up-regulate phospholipase-C which breaks down PIP-2 into di-acyl-glycerol and IP-3 resulting in the over-expression of protien kinase-C and increased calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum respectively. The end result of this intra-cellular reaction cascade is the release of follicle stimulating hormone from the anterior pituitary gland.\n\n - Mechanism of action of follicle stimulating hormone: it exerts it function by binding on to the G-coupled receptors of its designated target organs where the alpha subunit of the receptor would then activate adenylyl cyclase which up-regulates cAMP which activates protein kinase-A eventually resulting in phosphorylation and enabling follicle stimulating hormone to exert its desired effect on the target organ.\n\n - Functions of follicle stimulating hormone:\n \u25cf Stimulates the maturation of the ovum within the ovarian follicles.\n \u25cf Acts upon the granulosa cells to synthesize estradiol.\n \u25cf Plays a vital role in the female menstruation cycle.\n\n - Synthesis of estrogen: synthesized via the enzymatic biochemical reaction cascade occurring in the granulosa cells of the ovaries, the biochemical reaction cascade is detailed in the earlier section (see physiology of reproduction - androgen synthesis).\n\n - Mechanism of action of estrogen:. It carries out its action via the steroid hormone mechanism pathway. Estrogen, a lipid soluble hormone binds on to the extra-cellular receptors of the target organ located at the cell membrane or it could diffuse through the cell membrane and binds to its designated receptors in the cytoplasm thus forming a hormone-receptor complex. The hormone-receptor complex the enters the nucleus where it becomes embedded in the DNA for transcription. This transcription prompts the formation of a messenger RNA (mRNA) that leaves the nucleus and moves into the cytoplasm where it is translated into proteins that carry out the desired action meant by estrogen or estradiol (all steroid hormones use this mechanism to exert their end organ function)\n\n - Functions of estrogen or stradiol:\n \u25cf Developing the female secondary sex characteristics during pubertal age.\n \u25cf Maintain the integrity of the musculoskeletal system by decreasing calcium mobilization from the bones thus limiting bone resorption.\n \u25cf Development of the uterus during the female menstrual cycle for fertilized ovum implantation.\n \u25cf Develops the ducts and alveoli of the breast at the late stages of pregnancy.\n \u25cf Promotes vasodilation directly by acting on endothelial receptors or indirectly by promoting the production of nitric oxide, a vasodilating element.\n \u25cf Contributes to the thermo-regulatory mechanism in females where as it is evidenced in post-menopausal women for having hot flashed due to the lack of estrogen.\n\n - Synthesis of progesterone: synthesized via the enzymatic biochemical reaction cascade occurring in the corpus luteum of the ovaries, the biochemical reaction cascade is detailed in the earlier section.\n\n - Mechanism of action of progesterone: it carries out its action via the steroid hormone mechanism pathway. Progesterone, a lipid soluble hormone binds on to the extra-cellular receptors of the target organ located at the cell membrane or it could diffuse through the cell membrane and binds to its designated receptors in the cytoplasm thus forming a hormone-receptor complex. The hormone-receptor complex then enters the nucleus where it becomes embedded in the DNA for transcription. This transcription prompts the formation of a messenger RNA (mRNA) that leaves the nucleus and moves into the cytoplasm where it is translated into proteins that carry out the desired action meant by progestrone.\n\n - Functions of progesterone:\n \u25cf Promotes the development of uterine glands that nourish the uterine lining for implantation of the fertilized ovum.\n \u25cf Promotes the production of breast milk in the alveoli of the mammary gland.\n \u25cf Stimulates bone formation by the up-regulating osteoblast activity, a process that requires estrogen as the latter results in over-expression of progesterone receptors on of the bone.\n\n \u2713 Note that when secreted, all these hormones are bound to androgen-binding proteins and albumin and are not freely flowing through the blood stream as them binding to those proteins render them inactive.\n\n\"",

      "\"description_cardiac_cycle\" : \"\n The cardiac cycle describes the processes that the heart goes through from the moment it receives blood in the atria to ejecting the blood through the ventricles.\n\n \u25cf Atrial systole: the atria is being continuously filled with blood that is coming from the vena cavae (right atrium) and the pulmonary arteries (left atrium), once the pressure in the atria exceeds that of the ventricles due to the increase in blood volume, this forces the atrio-ventricular valves to open and blood flows into the ventricles. While blood is being emptied into the ventricles the atria then contracts/depolarizes thus ejecting its entire content into the ventricles, this process is referred to as atrial systole.\n\n \u25cf Ventricular filling: this is a two-phase process where first the ventricles are rapidly being filled at a low pressure and are both relaxed. As blood flows into the ventricles, its stream becomes progressively weaker thus initiating what is called the slow filling phase of the ventricles and at the end of this phase the ventricles now have attained the end-diastolic volume.\n\n \u25cf Isovolumetric ventricular contraction: occurs once the ventricular filling has stopped and the ventricles have dilated to accommodate its blood volume, both ventricles start to build in pressure as they prepare to fully contract and once this built pressure exceeds that of the atria, the mitral and tricuspid valves close then the ventricle is able to fully contract without blood being retrograded into the atria.\n\n \u25cf Ventricular ejection: this is a two-phase process that happens during ventricular contraction where the pressure built by the ventricles exceeds that of the aorta and pulmonary veins (ventricular depolarization) thereby opening the aortic and pulmonary valves to rapidly eject blood through them. The second phase is when the ejection stream weakens since most blood has been ejected and at the end of this phase, the remainder of blood in the ventricles is called the end systolic volume.\n\n \u25cf Isovolumetric ventricular relaxation: occurs after ventricular ejection where both ventricles repolarize/relax and their pressure markedly drops closing the aortic and pulmonary valves along with it. During this phase the atria are being filled with blood and the ventricles have relaxed in preparation to receive blood.\n\n\"",

      "\"description_lipid_digestion\" : \"\n The process of lipid digestion begins in the stomach and small intestine although salivary amylase mixes with the fat during chewing it only offers a minimum of chemical alteration of the lipids at a mere total of ten percent since it can only provide optimum digestion in an acidic environment, that of which is the stomach.\n\n In the stomach lingual lipase is fully enhanced along with gastric lipase they both manage to breakdown triglycerides by hydrolyzing their ester bonds and converting them to diglycerides, although with the vigorous mechanical digestion by gastric movements and the work of lipases this process only accounts for forty percent of lipid digestion.\n\n Fat is a hydrophobic matter and do not mix with the chyme therefore it is necessary for the bile salts and bile phospholipids carry out the emulsification process of lipids in the small intestine.\n\n - Emulsification of lipids in the small intestine: fat does not mix with the chyme instead it forms globules since chyme is predominantly made out of water therefore bile salts which are amphipathic in nature (soluble in fat and water) are brought in to emulsify the fats. Emusification is the process of dispersing two compounds into one another with out mixing their molecules, bile salts breakdown the fat globules into lipid droplets thus increases the surface area of the lipids by dispersing it into the chyme where lipase enzymes can breakdown fat more easily. Pancreatic lipase and colipase bind to the lipids to form a micelle which is a spherical object containing a hydrophobic core of fat along with pancreatic lipase and colipase and the hydrophobic surface of bile salts and an outer hydrophilic surface of the water soluble part of bile salts and lecithin that is dispersed within the chyme, those micelles then bind to the villi for absorption.\n\n\"",

      "\"description_posterior_pituitary_gland\" : \"\n The posterior pituitary gland is not biologically classified as a gland since it only stores and secrete hormones that are synthesized in the hypothalamus, antidiuretic hormone and oxytocin.\n\n - Antidiuretic hormone: synthesized by the supra-optic nuclei in the hpothalamus, ADH hormone while bound to neurophysin-2 (a carrier protein) is carried along the axons extending from the hypothalamus and traveling to the posterior pituitary lobe via the hypothalamic-hypophysial tract that passes through the infundibulum. In the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland, the nerve endings of these axons are seen as bulbs that store and secrete the hormone via exocytosis upon stimulation and once secreted, ADH hormone dissociated from its carrier protein.\n\n \u25cf Mechanism of action of antidiuretic hormone: antidiuretic hormone inhibits fluid loss through urine, this action comes along during the state of hypovolemia by increasing reabsorption through the distal convoluted tubule and collecting ducts. Antidiuretic hormone (also called vasopressin) binds to the G-protein coupled V-receptors of distal convoluted tubules and collecting ducts which in turn activates the adenylyl cyclase into cyclic AMP and the up-regulation of the latter results in protein kinase A activation that aids in the phosphorylation of intracellular proteins. This phosphorylation then up-rergulates the exocytosis of aquaporin-2 water channels to the luminal membrane fro water absorption.\n\n - Oxytocin: synthesized by the para-ventricular nuclei in the hypothalamus, oxytocin hormone while bound to neurophysin-1 (a carrier protein) is carried along the axons extending from the hypothalamus and traveling to the posterior pituitary lobe via the hypothalamic-hypophysial tract that passes through the infundibulum. In the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland, the nerve endings of these axons are seen as bulbs that store and secrete the hormone via exocytosis upon stimulation and once secreted, oxytocin hormone dissociated from its carrier protein.\n\n \u25cf Mechanism of action of oxytocin:\n \u25cf Let-down reflex: is the ejection of milk from the breast during breastfeeding/nursing, this reflex occurs when the infant is suckling on the breast. Due to weak oral muscles, the infant is not able to suck out the milk from the nipples therefore once suckling starts, it initiates excitation of the breast somatic nerves, the nerves carry the signals to the para-ventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus which in turn stimulates the release of oxytocin from the postirior pituitary gland and the oxytocin released causes contraction of the myoepithelial cells that line the alveoli , this results in ejection of the milk out of the alveoli into the ducts and out of the breast in process that takes less than a minute to completion.\n\n \u25cf Uterine contraction: during labour oxytocin is markedly increased and the uterus shows upregulation of oxytocin receptors to further enhance uterine contractions and expulsion of the fetus. The stretch being applied on the uterus during fetal decent into the birth canal which stimulates the somatic nerves that carry the impulse to the para-ventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus which in turn stimulates the release of oxytocin from the posterior pituitary gland.\n\n\"",

This effect is brought upon by the impulses carried via the sympathetic fibers from the medulla that release norepinephrine and exert their effects on the heart but their action doesn't end there. The sympathetic system also stimulates vessel contraction by activating the alpha-1 receptors this in turn increases blood pressure.\n\n\"",

This ligament demarcates the boundary between the abdomen and pelvis.\n\n - Inguinal triangle: lies in the infero-lateral aspect of the abdomen, most precisely at the medial part (medial to the pubic tubericle) of the inguinal ligament. It is bordered medially by the lateral border of the rectus abdominis muscle, inferiorly by the inguinal ligament, and laterally by the inferior epigastric vessels. The triangle is of significance as contents of the abdomen can herniate through it (mostly direct inguinal hernia).\n\n - Deep inguinal ring: formed by the tranversalis fascia, it lies halfway just above the inguinal ligament just lateral to the inferior epigastric vessels. It is the opening of the inguinal canal.\n\n - Inguinal canal: having a length of 5cm, it is a fibro-muscular channel that descends in an antero-medial fashion and opens into the superficial inguinal ring.

The spinal lemniscus then ascends from the medulla through the posterior part of the pons where it reaches the tegmentum of the midbrain (anterior part of mid brain; posterior part of midbrain is called tectum) lying lateral to the medial lemniscus. The fibers of the lateral spinothalamic tract then synapse in the ventral posterolateral nucleus (VPLN) of the thalamus (third order neuron), here crude pain (non-localized pain) is felt. Axons of the third order neuron in the ventral posterolateral nucleus of the thalamus send axons that pass through the posterior limb of the internal capsule and corona radiata to reach the postcentral gyrus of the cerebral cortex (part of the brain that receives sensory input). Damage to this pathway causes contralateral loss of pain and temperature sensation below the level of the lesion.\n\n - Anterior spinothalamic tract: is the light touch and pressure pathway, axons from the posterior root ganglion (1st order neuron) enter the spinal cord and continue to the tip of the posterior gray column and synapse in the substantia gelatinosa (2nd order neuron), then axons from the substantia gelatinosa cross obliquely to the contralateral side and ascend in the opposite anterolateral white column as the anterior spinothalamic tract to the medulla where it accompanies the lateral spinothalamic tract and the spinotectal tract. As mentioned previously the three tracts form the spinal lemniscus where the spinal lemniscus ascends to the posterior part of the pons, the tegmentum of the midbrain and eventually synapses in the in the VPLN of the thalamus (3rd order neuron) where crude touch and pressure are sensed here. Axons from the VPLN in the thalamus pass through the posterior limb of the internal capsule and the corona radiata to reach the postcentral gyrus of the cerebral cortex (part of the brain that receives sensory input). Damage to this tract causes contralateral loss of light/crude and pressure sensations below the level of the lesion.\n\n - Posterior white column: discriminative touch, vibration and conscious muscle joint sensations. The axons from the posterior root ganglion (1st order neuron) enter the spinal cord and continue directly to the posterior white column of the same side (axons do not cross) where they then ascend as the fasciculus gracilis (present along the entire length of the spinal cord) and fasciculus cuneatus (only present from C1-T6) with gracilis lying medially and cuneatus lying laterally and both are separated from each other by a septum. Axons of the fasciculus gracilis and fasciculus cuneatus ascend ispilaterally to terminate in the nucleus gracilis and cuneatus (2nd order neuron) of the medulla. Nucleus gracilis and cuneatus of the medulla sends axons called internal arcuate fibers which cross to the other side of the medulla (this crossing is called sensory decussation) and ascend as a single bundle which is called the medial lemniscus through the medulla, pons and midbrain to terminate in the VPLN of the thalamus (3rd order neuron). The VPLN of the thalamus sends axons through the posterior limb of the internal capsule and corona radiata to reach the postcentral gyrus of the cerebral cortex. Numerous axons of the fasciculus cuneatus from C1-T6, after terminating in the nucleus cuneatus (2nd order neuron) enter the cerebellum through the inferior cerebellar peduncle of the same side (cuneocerebellar tract) via posterior external arcuate fibers that transmit sensory information of muscle joint. Damage to this tract causes loss of discriminative touch, proprioceptive sensation (sensory ataxia), and vibratory sensations.\n\n - Posterior spinocerebellar tract: senses muscle joints and sends perceived information to the cerebellum. First lets get clear on a simple concept, the second order neuron involved in this tracts is the nucleus dorsalis which extends only from C8 to L4. Now that we got that out of the way, here is how we see the concept as being relevant. Impulses from the muscle joint (muscle spindles, tendon organs and joint receptors of the trunk and lower limb) enter the posterior root ganglion (first order neuron) then it enters the posterior gray horn of the spinal cord to synapse with the nucleus dorsalis which sends axons to the posterolateral part of the lateral white column of the same side, then these axons ascend as the posterior spinocerebellar tract to the medulla oblongata. From the medulla oblongata the tract enters the cerebellum through the inferior cerebellum peduncle, it does not continue to the cerebrum because of the fact that we mentioned earlier that the nucleus dorasalis only extends from C8-L4. The cerebellum uses the information for coordinating limb movements and maintaining posture.\n\n - Anterior spinocerebellar tract: impulses from the muscle joint receptors (muscle spindles, tendon organs and joint receptors of upper limb, lower limb and trunk) enter the posterior root ganglion then the posterior gray horn to synapse with the nucleus dosalis (by now hopefully you should know which is the 1st, 2nd and 3rd neuron) whose axons (majority of them) cross to the opposite side and ascend as the anterior spinocerebellar tract in the contralateral white column passing through the medulla and pons to enter the cerebellum via the superior cerebellar peduncle and with in the cerebellum the contralateral (crossing) fibers cross back to their original side.\n\n - Spinotectal tract: responsible for spinovisual reflexes moving the head and eye towards the source of stimulus (when you step on a nail you react to the pain generated by the nail through the spinotectal tract). Impulses travel from the receptor to the posterior root ganglion then enter the dorsal gray horn of the spinal cord to synapse to an unknown nucleus (that's right, UNKNOWN nucleus) which sends axons that cross to the opposite side to the anterolateral white column and ascending as the spinotectal tract passing through the medulla oblongata and pons, eventually synapsing with neurons in the superior colliculus of the midbrain.\n\n - Spionreticular tract: sends impulses to the reticular formation which has an important role in consciousness (discussed later in this section). Axons from the receptor travel to the posterior root ganglion and synapse to an unknown second neuron in the gray matter of the spinal cord which sends ascending axons (does not cross) from the lateral white column as the spinoreticular tract to synapse with neurons of the reticular formation in the medulla oblongata, pons and midbrain.\n\n - Spino-olivary tract: sends information from skin and proprioceptive organs to the cerebellum. Impulses from the receptor travel to the posterior root ganglion to synapse to an unknown second neuron in the posterior gray matter of the spinal cord which sends axons that cross to the opposite side to ascend as the spino-olivary tract from the junction of the anterior and lateral white columns to synapse in the olivary nuclei (third order neuron) in the medulla oblongata, the reticular nuclei send axons to the which cross to the original side to enter the cerebellum through the inferior cerebellum peduncle.\n\n\"",

      "\"description_gas_exchange\" : \"\n Gas exchange within the lungs occurs between the alveoli and pulmonary capillaries where oxygen is perfusion-driven from the air sacs to the blood of the capillaries and carbon dioxide is also perfusion-driven from the capillaries to the alveoli for exhalation, a number of factors contribute to the gas exchange process that occurs in the lungs.\n\n - Factors contributing to the gas exchange process:\n \u25cf Thickness of the alveolar-capillary membrane: a normal alveolar-capillary membrane is measured to have a thickness of 0.2 micrometers which delivers an optimal gas exchange ratio. In cases of fibrosis, sarcoidosis, pneumonia or congestive heart disease (any condition that results in inflammation and edema) the alveolar-capillary membrane thickens and so its difficult for the gas particles (O2 and CO2) to travel through a thick membrane thus decreasing the gas exchange ratio.\n\n \u25cf Surface area of the alveolar-capillary membrane: a decrease in the surface area permits a lower range of gas exchange and this is mostly notices in pathological conditions that result in air entrapment within the alveoli such as chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases. For instance, in emphysema the alveolar walls merge with one another forming one large alveolus, this process markedly decreases the surface area of the lung thereby providing a lesser gas exchange ratio.\n\n \u25cf Gas diffusion coefficient: the rate at which gas particles move across a membrane depending on their weight and solubility within that membrane. In the lungs and due to its solubility, CO2 diffuses at a rapid rate and about as 20 times faster than oxygen while oxygen diffuses twice as fast as nitrogen. An important concept to understand is that CO2 and O2 are perfusion-limited meaning that they will continue to diffuse till they form a pressure gradient equilibrium then the diffusion process halts but if the pressure gradient were to proceed, another batch of blood (low O2 and high CO2) must come in to maintain the pressure gradient since the present batch has reached equilibrium.\n\n \u25cf Pressure gradient: gases travel from higher pressure to lower pressure and since the blood in the capillaries reaching the lungs is low in oxygen but rich with CO2, this drives alveolar O2 to diffuse into the capillaries and the CO2 of the capillaries to diffuse into the alveoli which has a lesser concentration of CO2. Another example is carbon monoxide which has a high diffusion coefficient but is not as soluble as CO2, however, it is diffusion-limited and strongly binds to hemoglobin on the RBCs and so there are no CO molecules in the blood to form a pressure gradient thus CO continues to diffuse until a pressure gradient is achieved (diffusion-limited).\n\n \u2713 The partial pressure of O2 in the atmosphere is measured to be 160 mm hg but that isn't the case in the alveoli. The partial pressure of oxygen in the alveoli is measured to be 103 mm hg, this reduction happens due to humidification of the air entering the airways as it is heated up by the body's temperature thus losing its atmospheric pressure by almost 40 mm hg as it reaches the alveoli. The deoxygenated blood within the capillaries has an oxygen partial pressure of is measured to be 40 mm hg driving the oxygen from the alveoli to the capillaries according to the pressure gradient (60 mm hg) and the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the deoxygenated capillary blood is measured to be 42 mm hg while that of the alveoli is 0 mm hg and so CO2 diffuses from the capillary through the alveoli according to the pressure gradient.\n\n\"",

      "\"description_ventilation_mechanics\" : \"\n Ventilation involves inspiration and expiration with inspiration being an active process having a number of factors affecting it while expiration is a passive process occurring simultaneously at the end of inspiration.\n\n - Factors affecting inspiration:\n \u25cf Muscles: the diaphragm and intercostal muscles function in expanding the thoracic cavity and the lungs when contracting. The diaphragm moves downwards and the intercostal muscles lift the ribcage upwards and laterally, this causes expansion and promote inflow of air to the lungs.\n\n \u25cf Pressure difference: normally the pressure within the lungs equals atmospheric pressure and for air to move in the lungs need to be at a negative pressure status, this is achieved by the expansion of the thoracic cavity and lungs (more space; less pressure hence negative). The intrapleural pressure also contributes to this since it is normally at negative pressure and provides suction of air into the lung during expansion as it becomes more negative.\n\n \u25cf Surfactant: the alveoli are lined by a thin film of water and those water molecules adhere to one another forming tension on the alveolar surface which causes the alveoli to collapse and failure of inflation. The surfactant which is a combination of phospholipids (lecithin, phosphatidylcholine etc) produced by pneumocyte cells type-2 reduces the adherence between the water molecules thus preventing alveolar collapse.\n\n \u25cf Compliance: compliance of the lung is the ability and extent to which the lungs can expand and hold air within which is determined by the elasticity of the lung tissue. A normal lung with normal elasticity can expand up to holding six liters of air but the amount of air at the end of inspiration is measured at 2900mL. A lung with fibrosis will hold less than that since it won't expand to the optimum size as the lung tissue have stiffened and a lung with emphysema will have be able to hold more than the optimum volume of air since the elasticity is lost but the alveoli are already enlarged and inspiration adds in more air resulting in further enlargement.\n\n - Expiration: is a passive process occurring once the pressure within the lungs or the alveolar pressure have reached a positive value above the atmospheric pressure, this results in the outflow of air from the lungs.\n\n\"",

      "\"description_urine_concentration\" : \"\n Urine concentration is the process in which the end-filtrate that is soon to be urine has its ions concentration modified in relation to the osmolarity in plasma. Urine concentration is a process highly influenced by hormones, mainly the Anti-diuretic hormone (ADH).\n\n \u2713 When the body loses water or is in a state of hypovolemia, plasma osmolarity increases since more solutes are present compared to water and so the body tries to retain normal plasma osmolarity through urine. When plasma osmolarity decrease due to water retention, the body tries to lose the excess water via increasing urine volume.\n\n - High plasma osmolarity:\n \u25cf An increase in plasma osmolarity means an increase in sodium and other solutes.\n\n \u25cf The osmoreceptors of the lamina terminalis (anterior hypothalamus) detect the change in osmolarity and stimulate thirst.\n\n \u25cf In response to increased plasma osmolarity, the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland releases antidiuretic hormone as part of the positive feedback cycle.\n\n \u25cf The anti-diuretic hormone then acts on the principal cells of the late distal convoluted tubule and collecting ducts to up-regulate the exocytosis of aquaporin-two channels into the cell membrane.\n\n \u25cf The aquaporin-two channels increase in number thus more water is reabsorbed in efforts to help the raised plasma osmolarity return to normal.\n\n \u25cf As more water is absorbed from urine by the tubules, the volume of urine decreases and the osmolarity of urine increases making it concentrated with solutes.\n\n - Low plasma osmolarity:\n \u25cf A decrease in plasma osmolarity means that water is present with abdundance in the extracellular fluid having to make solutes volume low in comparison.\n\n \u25cf This results in the inhibition of the lamina terminalis (anterior hypothalamus) as osmoreceptors sense the increased volume of extracellular fluid thereby terminating the sense of thirst.\n\n \u25cf As part of the negative feedback cycle, the posterior lobe is inhibited from secreting the anti-diuretic hormone and so exocytosis of the aquaporin-two channels does not take place.\n\n \u25cf Since the aquaporin channels are inhibited by the lack of ADH, excess water is lost in urine and so urine increases in volume and becomes more dilute, this process helps plasma osmolarity return to normal.\n\n - Urea reabsorption: as ADH acts upon the late distal convoluted tubule and collecting duct to reabsorb water, the concentration of urea (secreted in the thin ascending limb) in the filtrate increases. ADH also up-regulates urea transport channels (UT-one) allowing urea to move out of the tubules in the renal interstitium via the process of diffusion down its concentration gradient. This diffusion process is crucial because it creates a pulling force on the thin descending limb to absorb more water and the amounts of urea diffused into the interstiutium re-enter the tubules via the process of secretion by the thin ascending limb and the remainder of urea in the collecting tubule is excreted in urine.\n\n - Calcium regulation:\n \u25cf Calcium reabsorption: mainly influenced by parathyroid hormone, this process takes place in the proximal convoluted tubule, the thick ascending limb of loop of henle, and the distal convoluted tubule. Calcium is absorbed via the para-cellular and trans-cellular pathway, the para-cellular absorption mechanism takes place in the proximal convoluted tubule and the thick ascending limb of loop of henle where calcium diffuses down its electrochemical gradient in between the gaps of the luminal cells to the renal interstium. Both convoluted tubules and the thick ascending limb of loop of henle support the trans-celluar pathway where calcium is actively transported via luminal calcium channels into the cell while on the basolateral membrane there are two types of calcium channels that transport calcium out of the cell and into the renal interstium; a calcium-ATPase channel and a 3Na-Ca counter transport channels that allows entry of three sodium ions into the cell with simultaneous ejection of one calcium ion into the renal interstium. Calcium is not secreted by the tubules since almost all filtered calcium is reabsorbed.\n\n \u25cf Calcium excretion: calcium is excreted in both urine and feces but more in feces than urine since it is extensively absorbed by renal tubules. When plasma calcium levels are high, the negative feedback cycle initiates the inhibition of parathyroid hormone and so less amounts of calcium are absorbed in the renal tubules and small intestines resulting in the excretion of excess calcium ions.\n\n - Potassium regulation:\n \u25cf Potassium absorption: like calcium, almost all filtered potassium ions are reabsorbed by the convoluted tubules and thick ascending limb, where it can be absorbed via the para-cellular pathway in the proximal convoluted tubule and through active channels as in the thick ascending limb of loop of henle via he Na-2Cl-K co-transporter and the H-K ATPase counter-pump (hydrogen proton ejected out of the cell into the lumen while potassium is brought into the cell) of the alpha-intercalated cells in the distal convoluted tubule and collecting ducts. At the basolateral membrane of all tubules, sodium is released into the renal interstitium via the open gated potassium channels.\n\n \u25cf Potassium secretion: high levels of potassium in the extracellular fluid and plasma favors secretion of potassium by the principal cells of the distal convoluted tubule and collecting ducts for the excretion of excess potassium.\n\n \u2713 Factors that increase potassium levels in the extra-cellular fluid (ECF) and plasma:\n \u25cf Acidosis: where high levels of hydrogen protons are present in the ECF, this increases the acidity of the latter and in order to reverse this state, hydrogen protons are absorbed by the cells and potassium is released out of the cell in exchange thus increasing potassium concentration in the ECf and plasma.\n\n \u25cf Low insulin levels: insulin draws potassium into the cell as it up-regulates and increases the activity of the H-K ATPase counter pump and when it is circulating at low levels no potassium is absorbed into the cells which results in high levels of potassium in the ECF and plasma.\n\n \u25cf Increased plasma osmolarity: with increases plasma osmolarity, water moves out of the cell and into the plasma down ts concentration gradient and as water moves out of the cell, it exerts a pulling force on potassium thus moving the latter outside the cell along with it.\n\n - Phosphate regulation: the majority of the filtered phosphate is reabsorbed in the proximal convoluted tubule via the sodium-phosphate co-transporter. Unlike other ions, phosphate absorption exhibits a threshold that once reached there will be no more phosphate absorption no matter the abundance. PTH increase the absorption of calcium but not that of phosphate since it inhibits the NA-K co-transporter in the proximal tubule resulting in the loss of phosphate in urine.\n\n\"",

      "\"description_pulmonary_circulation\" : \"\n The lungs receive blood from the right ventricle which is equal tot he cardiac output for oxygenation and clearance of CO2. the pressure in the pulmonary arterial circulation is equal to that of the right ventricle which is estimated to be 25 mm hg, however the blood in the pulmonary veins lies at a 2mm hg, such change is owed to the dissipation of blood pressure along the series arrangement of the pulmonary vessels.\n\n the right ventricle pumps blood through the pulmonary trunk that divides into pulmonary arteries, blood flows through these arteries into the pulmonary arterioles (where most pressure has been dissipated) then into the capillaries where the exchange of substances occur. once blood reaches pressure gradient equilibrium it continues to flow into the venules. at this stage, the blood in the pulmonary venous circulation has lost the majority of its pressure and is no longer equal to that of the right atrium. from the venules, blood then flows into the pulmonary veins (rich in oxygen) which empty into the left atrium.\n\n - zonal distribution of blood flow:\n \u25cf lung zone 1: blood reaches this zone in scarce amounts due to the gravitational pull and high alveolar pressure along with low ventilation that impedes the circulation within the zone, this causes the blood to be redirected into other areas of better perfusion and ventilation.\n\n \u25cf lung zone 2: this lung zone reaches its highest peek of perfusion at the start of right atrial systole and lowest perfusion status at the end of systole.\n\n \u25cf lung zone 3: this zone of the lung has the highest perfusion and ventilation. since alveolar pressure is lower than the arterial pressure, the vessels are not compressed and blood flow freely though, and highest ventilation since the alveoli aren't enlarged and so more surface area is being provided for gas exchange. blood flow through the third zone of the lung remains unchanged through the duration of right ventricular systole.\n\n\"",

      "\"description_hemocardiac_interrelations\" : \"\n Hemocardiac interrelations are best visualized during hemorrhage showing how blood volume and cardiac activity are strongly related.\n\n - Hemorrhage is defined in four stages:\n \u25cf Stage one: is when there is 15 percent loss of total blood which adds up to roughly 750ml with a range of 600-750ml. Hear rate and blood pressure during this stage is maintained at normal levels (due to the compensatory mechanisms explained later in this section) along with the respiratory rate and a urine output of over 30ml/hour (normal is 1.5-2ml/kg/hr; less than 30ml means deterioration).\n\n \u25cf Stage 2: is when there is a 15-29.9 percent loss of total blood which adds up to roughly 751-1500ml. Hear rate is increased reaching 120 beats per minute with blood pressure remaining normal during this stage as it is maintained by the compensatory mechanisms. The respiratory rate increases during this stage to the 20-30 breaths per minute range while urine output decreases to become within the 20-30ml/hour range.\n\n \u25cf Stage 3: is when there is 30-40 percent loss of total blood which adds up to roughly 1.5-2L. Heart rate further increases to reach the 120-140 bpm range and blood pressure decreases as the compensatory mechanisms fail to compensate for this much blood. The respiratory rate also drastically increases to be within the 30-40 breaths per minute range while urine output markedly decreases to fall with in the 5-15ml per hour range. This stage resembles borderline hemorrhagic shock and is a non compensatory stage.\n\n \u25cf Stage 4: is when there is above 40 percent loss of total blood which adds up to more than 2L. Heart rate during this stage increases to more than 140bpm and blood pressure is intensively decreased as hyperventilation occurs with a respiratory rate above 35 breaths per minute. Since there is extensive loss of blood and very low blood pressure, not enough blood reaches the kidney for filtration and urine production therefore the individual is in a state of anuria. This stage is defined as hemorrhagic shock and is associated with hypothermia.\n\n - Compensatory mechanisms of shock:\n \u25cf Baroreceptor reflex: is the immediate response to hemorrhage where blood loss causes a drop in blood pressure that is detected by the baro-receptors of the aortic arch and carotid sinus which results in activation of the sympathetic system resulting in vasoconstriction (not just of the arteries but of the veins too inorder to increase venous return) and increase in heart rate, during the first two phases of hemorrhage this mechanism is able to maintain blood pressure but with the continuous loss of blood it fails to serve its purpose.\n\n \u25cf Anti-diuretic hormone: when decreased blood volume and increased blood osmolarity are detected, anti-diuretic hormone acts upon blood vessels and renal ducts causing vasoconstriction and increase water and salt retention, this results in increased blood volume and brings osmolarity back to within its normal range.\n\n \u25cf - Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system: the reactions occurring in this system are purely hormonal and so would take days to achieve homeostasis. Once the decreased blood volume is detected by decreased renal perfusion, this system goes through a series of reactions where the end products aldosterone and angiotensin-2 cause salt and water retention thereby increasing blood volume, it also stimulates the release of anti-diuretic hormone, vasoconstriction, and water intake (by acting upon the hypothalamus to stimulate thirst).\n\n\"",
      "\"description_valvular_defect_patho\" : \"\n Cardiac valvular defects are one of the major causes disrupting the heart's hemodynamics, this section will hold the discussion on valvular heart defects and their consequent phathophysiology.\n\n - Aortic valve stenosis: is the hardening of the aortic valve leaflets due to calcification that occurs as a result of wear and tear seen in older individuals or it can also occur in those born with two aortic valve leaflets. This condition results in increased end-diastolic volume and concentric hypertrophy of the left ventricle eventually leading to left heart failure if not treated early.\n\n \u25cf Clinical presentation of aortic valve stenosis: it presents with dypnea upon exertion and syncope at first whereas in the late stages of the disease it results in pulmonary edema (pulmonary hypertension; Eisenmenger syndrome) and orthopnea (shortness of breath at supine position)/paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (waking up at night gasping for air) with crescendo-decrescendo mid-systolic murmur on the right third intercostal space.\n\n \u25cf Diagnosis and management of AVS: this condition is diagnosed with echocardiogram and managed via surgical ballon valvuloplasty.\n\n - Pulmonary valve stenosis: is a condition that is often congenital in origin where the individual affected is born with two pulmonary valve leaflets. This condition results in end-diastolic volume of the right ventricle with concentric hypertrophy to eventually progress into right heart failure.\n\n \u25cf Clinical presentation of PVS: it presents with lightheadedness and fatigue associated with peripheral edema and mid-systolic murmur heard on the left third intercostal space.\n\n \u25cf Diagnois and management of PVS: this condition is diagnosed by echocardiogram and managed with and managed with balloon valvuloplasty.\n\n - Mitral stenosis: is the thickening and fusion of the mitral valve leaflets as a result of rheumatic valve disease (rheumatic fever in response to group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal infection of the throat). This condition prohibits the full emptying of the left atrium thus causing the latter to dilate as it houses more volumes of blood, this results in increased atrial pressure. As pressure builds up, the atria dilates and pulling the nerve fibers with it resulting in atrial fibrillation (potential embolus formation) and pulmonary hypertension (potential pulmonary edema).\n\n \u25cf Clinical presentation of MVS: it presents with mitral facies (redness of the cheeks), dyspnea on exertion, increased fatigue associated with orthopnea/paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and a mid-diastolic (rumbling character) murmur at the left fifth intercostal space preceded by an opening snap and crackles at the lower lung lobes.\n\n \u25cf Diagnosis and management of MVS: this condition is diagnosed by echocardiogram and managed with furosemide, heparin, and surgical valve replacement.\n\n - Tricuspid stenosis: is the thickening and fusion of the tricuspid valve leaflets that occur as a result of rheumatic valve disease. This condition prohibits the right atrium to fully empty and as a result there is less blood flowing to the lung for oxygenation, more blood accumulates in the peripheral venous circulation, and dilation of the right atrium with increased intr-atrial pressure.\n\n \u25cf Clinical presentation of TVS: it presents with lightheadedness, peripheral edema, increased jugular venous pressure, and a mid-diastolic murmur on the left fourth intercostal space.\n\n \u25cf Diagnosis and management of TVS: this condition is diagnosed with echocardiogram and managed with furosemide and surgical valve replacement.\n\n - Aortic regurgitation: is incompetency of the aortic valve to close fully post-systole enabling retrograde blood flow from the aorta to the left ventricle. It is caused by infective endocarditis or dilation of the aortic root (classically seen in tertiary syphilis). It results in increased afterload with left ventricular hypertrophy and increased cardiac output with characteristic low diastolic pressure (high preload and afterload).\n\n \u25cf Clinical presentation of AR: it presents with lightheadedness, fatigue, and syncope with collapsing pulse (water-hammer) associated with decrescendo diastolic murmur at the right third intercostal space.\n\n \u23cf Diagnosis and management of AVR: this condition is diagnosed with echocardiogram and managed with enalapril and surgical valve replacement.\n\n - Pulmonary valve regurgitation: it is the incompetency of the pulmonary valve to fully close post-systole enabling retrograde blood flow from the pulmonary trunk back to the right ventricle. This condition results in increased afterload and right ventricular hypertrophy.\n\n \u25cf Clinical presentation of PVR: it presents with fatigue and peripheral edema with early diastolic decrescendo murmur on the left third intercostal space.\n\n \u25cf Diagnosis and management of PVR: this condition is diagnosed by echocradiogram and managed with surgical valve replacement.\n\n - Mitral regurgitation: it is the incompetency of the mitral valve to fully close during ventricular systole enabling retrograde blood flow from the left ventricle into the left atrium resulting in increased afterload and preload in both cardiac chambers with consequent hypertrophy and eventual left sided heart failure and pulmonary edema.\n\n \u25cf Clinical presentation of MVR: it presents with dyspnea, shortness of breath, fatigue and orthopnea/paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea with peripheral edema and an associated holosystolic murmur at the sixth intercostal space.\n\n \u25cf Diagnosis and management of MVR: this condition is diagnosed with echocradiogram and managed with surgical valve replacement.\n\n \u25cf Tricuspid regurgitation: is incompetency of the tricuspid valve to close during ventricular systole enabling retrograde blood flow from the right ventricle into the right atrium resulting in increased preload and afterload of both cardiac chambers with consequent hypertrophy and eventful right sided heart failure. It is caused by infective endocarditis (S.aureus; IV drug abusers sharing needles).\n\n \u25cf Clinical presentation of TVR: presents with fatigue, and peripheral edema with increased jugular venous pressure and a holosystolic blowing murmur at the fourth intercostal space.\n\n \u25cf Diagnosis and management of TVR: this condition is diagnosed by echocardiogram and managed with surgical valve replacement.\n\n - Mitral valve prolapse: is the ballooning of the mitral valve during left ventricular systole resulting in mitral regurgitation. It is caused by a non-inflammatory degeneration of the valve (myxematous; collagen type4).\n\n \u25cf Clinical presentation of MVP: it presents with fatigue, dyspnea, and moderate chest pain associated with systolic click followed by holosystolic murmur.\n\n \u25cf Diagnosis and management of MVP: this condition is diagnosed by electrocardiogram and managed with surgical valve replacement.\n\n\"",

      "\"description_antiparkinson_pharma\" : \"\n - Levidopa/carbidopa: a precursor of dopamine as it is converted in the brain (by the enzyme aromatic-L amino acid decarboxylase) to compensate for the deficient latter, it exerts its dopamine-like function on the striatal and substantia nigra pathways by binding to their respective dopaminergic D1 and D2 receptors, it also increases dopamine release. Carbidopa is a decarboxylase inhibitor which prevents the degradation and conversion of levodpa (to dopamine) in the systemic circulation, it also helps with easing some of the adverse effects of levodopa. Its absorption varies as food lowers the rate of absorption with high bioavailability if consumed on an empty stomach, it is minimally bound to plasma proteins thereby offering a high volume of distribution. Dopamine is metabolized in the brain and systemic circulation by the enzymes catechol-O-methyl transferase, aldehyde dehydrogenase, and monoamine oxidase-A/B (levidopa/carbidopa half life is 2 days) and is excreted in urine. Adverse effects include headache, dizziness, increased sleep, hallucinations, agitation, dry mouth, nausea and vomiting (carbidopa relieves levodopa-induced nausea), diarrhea, brown discoloration of body secretions, and dyskinesia. Contraindications of this medication includes kidney impairment, closed-angle glaucoma, peptic ulcer, urinary retention, diabetes, depression, and dyskinesia. This medication is used for Parkinsons disease.\n\n - Ropinirole: a dopamine agonist, functions by binding to the post-synaptic D2 and D3 receptors of the corpus striatum and exerting a dopamine-like effect. It is well absorbed following oral intake, however, this drug goes through first pass metabolism therefore only half of the administered dose is made available (half life of 4-6 hours), moreover, most of the available dose is bound to plasma proteins thereby offering a low volume of distribution and is excreted in urine. Adverse effects include headache, dizziness, drowsiness, hallucinations, fainting, agitation, tremors, blurry vision, dry mouth, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, peripheral edema, and dyskinesia. Contraindications of this medication includes liver and kidney impairment, pregnancy, and hypersensitive individuals. This medication is used for parkinsons disease.\n\n - Trihexyphenidyl: a cholinergic antagonist, functions by binding to and blocking the M1 post-synaptic receptors and thereby inhibiting acetylcholine release, it also inhibits pre-synaptic dopamine uptake and increases dopamine striatal release. It is well absorbed following oral intake achieving high bioavailability, however, less than half of the administered dose is bound to plasma proteins thereby offering a high volume of distribution.

In turn the vagus centers send out efferent activating impulses to the submucosal plexus and the latter stimulates the gastrointestinal glands to release their secretions.\n\n - The sympathetic nervous system applies an inhibitory effect on the gastrointestinal tract by halting both movement and secretions via its hormones norepinephrine and nitiric oxide. The sympathetic nerve fibers arise from the spinal cord segments T5-L2 and from the celiac, superior and inferior mesenteric, and the hypogastric plexuses.\n\n - The parasympathetic system functions in stimulating motility and secretion of the alimentary canal via acetylcholine and substance-P, the vagus nerve exerts its parasympathetic action from the esophagus up to the medial half of the transverse colon and the nerves S1-S3 provide their parasympathetic innervation to the remainder of the alimentary canal.\n\n\"",
      "\"description_developmental_pathologies_cns\" : \"\n Developmental pathologies of the central nervous system are those occurring during fetal life where some are incompatible with life while others can be managed with supportive therapy.\n\n - Craniosynostosis: is the abnormal early closure of cranial sutures resulting in characteristic dome-shaped deformity of the skull seen in newborns. Due to the early closure, the skull fails to expand and the intra-cranial vicinity is unable to accommodate the increasing levels of cerebro-spinal fluid, this results in increased intra-cranial pressure and is often accompanied with hydrocephalus.\n\n - Hydrocephalus: is the accumulation of increased cerebro-spinal fluid in the ventricles of the brain via congenital or acquired causes. a well known cause of congenital hydrocephalus is the stenosis of the cerebral aqueduct which fails to drain the cerebro-spinal fluid from the third to fourth ventricles and inevitably resulting in increased intra-cranial pressure seen in newborns. The increased intracranial pressure caused by cerebro-spinal fluid accumulation results in expansion of the intracranial vicinity which in turn widens the space between the cranial sutures and results in a deformed enlarged skull with the eyes deviated downwards.\n\n - Arnold-chiari malformation I: is herniation of the cerebellar tonsils through the foramen magnum to lie just below the latter often causing parasthesia, numbness, tremors, uncoordinated gait and eye movement however its signs and symptoms are late occurring.\n\n - Arnold-chiari malformation II: is the herniation of the cerebellar tonsils and the lower cerebellar vermis through the foramen magnum where the herniated structures compress over the medulla and brain stem resulting in cardio-pulmonary compromisation. This condition's findings are evident as early as birth.\n\n - Arnold-chiari III: is herniation of the entire cerebellum and the fourth ventricle of the brain through the foramen magnum resulting in a encephalocele which is a sac-like structure located at base of the occipital surface of the skull containing the herniated contents, this condition is incompatible with life.\n\n - Arnold-chiari malformation IV: is the failure of the cerebellum to develop (cerebellar aplasia) or development of a small-sized cerebellum (cerebellar hypoplasia) where of imaging the posterior fossa appears to be empty. Like chiari 3, this condition is incompatible with life.\n\n - Dandy-walker malformation: is malformation or agenesis of the cerebellar vermis, this condition is characterized by hypoplasia of the cerebellum with dilation of the ventricles and posterior fossa. Affected individuals present with spastic paraplegia, uncoordinated gait and eye movement, and loss of fine motor action.\n\n - Anencephaly: is the agenesis of the brain and skull due to failure of the cranial end of the neural tube to close and the fetus is born with out a skull. One important early sign is polyhydraminios since the child is not alive in the womb and swallowing of the aminiotic fluid is impaired.\n\n - Spina bifida: a condition occurring due to failure of the caudal end of the neural tube to close, this results in agenesis of the corresponding vertebral segment with protrosion of a cystic sac covered with skin or hair (spina bifida occulta).\n\n - Meningocele: is a form spinda bifida where there is protrusion of the meninges into the cystic sac.\n\n - Myelomeningocele: is a form of spina bifida where there is protrusion of the spinal cord, meninges, and the cerebro-spinal fluid into the cystic sac.

Its functions include serving as a conduit for ascending and descending tacts of the spinal cord connecting them to the cerebral cortex, contains respiratory and cardiovascular reflex centers, and contains nuclei of cranial nerves 3-12.\n\n - Gross features:\n \u25cf Medulla oblongata: the anterior surface of the medulla shows a median anterior fissure that continues on the same path downwards as the anterior median fissure of the spinal cord. The anterior median fissure of the medulla shows a swelling on both sides, these swellings called pyramids. Posterior to the pyramids shows oval elevations produced by the inferior olivary nuclei called olives and posterior to the olives lies the inferior cerebellar peduncle. The posterior surface of the inferior half of the medulla shows a posterior median sulcus and its surface is continuos with the posterior surface of the spinal cord. The posterior surface of the medulla shows an elevation called the gracile tubercle produced by gracilis nuclei and just lateral to it is the cuneate tubercle produced by the cuneate nucleus.\n\n \u25cf Pons: its anterior surface is convex on the right and left, shows horizontal fibers running across the surface and a groove at the midline called the basilar groove where the basilar artery lies. The groove between the medulla and pons shows the emergence of three nerves, (medial to lateral) abducent, facial, vestibulocochlear nerves. moreover, the trigeminal nerve emerges from the anterolateral surface of the pons. The posterior surface of the pons lies directly anterior to the cerebellum with a line in the middle called the median sulcus dividing the surface into halves. On both sides of the median sulcus is an elevation called the medial eminence with its inferior end showing another elevation created by the abducent nerve called the facial colliculus, the median eminence on both sides is limited laterally by the sulcus limitans where at its superior part shows the substantia ferruginea, a blue-gray sulcus (it possess such color due to its underlying pigmented neurons). Lateral to sulcus limitans is the area vestibuli which is produced by the underlying vestibular nuclei and the entire posterior surface of the pons is limited by the superior cerebellar peduncle on each side.\n\n \u25cf Midbrain: the anterior surface shows a depression called the interpeduncular fossa wwith its floor being perforated by vessels giving it the name the posterior perforated substance. On both sides of the interpeduncular fossa lies the crus cerbri from which the oculomotor nerve emerges through a groove on the medial side of the crus cerebri. The posterior surface shows four colliculi (round eminence) two superior (concerned with visual reflexes) and two inferior (concerned with lower auditory centers). Below the inferior colliculi and at the midline the two trochlear nerves emerge. On the lateral side of the midbrian lies the superior and inferior brachi and both ascend in an anterolateral pathway where the superior brachium passes from the superior colliculus to the lateral geniculate body then to the optic tract whereas the inferior brachium serves as connecting point between the inferior colliculus and the medial geniculate body.\n\n - Internal features:\n \u25cf Medulla oblongata: the internal features in the medulla are regarded to as four levels; level of decussation of pyramids, level of lemnisci, level of olives and a level just about inferior to the pons. The level of pyramid decussation is the motor decussation of descending motor fibers. In the superior part of the medulla the corticospinal fibers form the pyramid and inferiorly most fibers cross to the opposite side and descend in the lateral white column as the lateral corticospinal tract. In the medulla at the level of pyramid decussation the substantia gelatinosa which was located in the posterior gray column of the spinal cord becomes continuous with the inferior end of the nucleus of the spinal tract of the trigeminal nerve. contents of the medulla at the level of pyramid deccusation are fasciculus gracilis and cuneatus, nucleus gracilis and cuneatus, spinal nucleus of trigeminal nerve, spinal tract of trigeminal nerve, spinal root of accessory nerve, medial longitudinal fasciculus, medial accessory olivary nucleus, lateral corticospinal tract, posterior and anterior spinocerebellar tract and anterior spinothalamic tract.\n\n Level of lemnisci deccusation happens above the level of pyramid deccusation and is the sensory decusation of ascending fibers. As we discussed earlier the lemnisci are formed from the internal arcuate fibers that arise from the anterior part of nucleus gracilis and cuneatus. Contents of the medulla at this level are fasciculus gracilis and cuneatus, nucleus gracilis and cuneatus, internal arcuate fibers, spinal nucleus of trigeminal nerve, spinal tract of trigeminal nerve, lateral and anterior spinothalamic tract, spinotectal tract, spinocerebellar tract, vestibulospinal tract, rubrospinal tract, spinal root of accessory nerve, inferior olivary nucleus, hypoglossal nerve, medial longitudinal fasciculus, hypoglossal nucleus.\n\n \u2713 level of olives passes through the inferior part of the 4th ventricle with increased amounts of gray matter due to the presence of the olivary nuclear complex; nuclei of vestibulocochlear, glossopharyngeal, vagus accessory and the hypoglossal nerves with the arcute nuclei.

Contraindications of this medication includes pre-existing cardiac pathologies, pregnancy, and breastfeeding females.\n\n - Paclitaxel: functions by binding to and blocking the beta-tubulin subunit of the mitotic spindle thereby inhibiting assembly of microtubules, this results in cell arrest in the late G2 phase of the cell cycle and failure of cell division/mitosis in the M phase of the cell cycle. As it is administered intravenously therefore has rapid absorption and complete bioavailability with high volume of distribution. It is metabolized by the liver (half life of 12-22 hours) and is excreted in feces. Contraindications of this medication includes neutropenia, pregnancy, breastfeeding females, and hypersensitive individuals.\n\n - Irinotecan: a topoisomerase one inhibitor, the latter functions by removing the supercoiling of the double strand DNA by causing a break in one DNA strand at one DNA segment during the unwinding process of DNA replication, as topoisomerase one is inhibited, mutant strands of DNA are produced resulting in cell death. As it is administered intravenously therefore has rapid absorption and complete bioavailability with high volume of distribution. It is metabolized by the liver (half life of 8-12 hours) and is excreted in feces and urine. Contraindications of this medication includes liver and kidney impairment, pregnancy, breastfeeding females, and mechanical obstruction of the gastrointestinal tract.\n\n - Adverse effects of chemotherapy:\n \u25cf Neurological: dizziness, disrupted cognition, depression, encephalopathy, seizure, memory deficit, peripheral neuropathy, visual disturbances, and corneal deposits.\n\n \u25cf Cardiac: cardiac conduction pathologies, pericarditis, myocarditis, valvular dysfunction, dilated cardiomyopathy, and myocardial infarction following oxidative stress by free radicals.\n\n \u25cf Pulmonary: hypersensitivity pneumonitis, interstitial pneumonia, interstitial lung fibrosis, pulmonary hemorrhage, and cryptogenic organizing pneumonia.\n\n \u25cf Gastrointestinal: mouth ulcers, nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, gastroenteritis, hepatitis, typhylitis (inflammation of the cecum), and neutropenic entercolitis (inflammation of the small intestine, namely the ileum).\n\n \u25cf Genitourinary: urinary retention/incontinence, urinary tract infection, hemorrhagic cystitis, acute tubular necrosis, renal papillary necrosis, male and female infertility, vaginal dryness and ulcers.\n\n\"",

      "\"description_ventilation_perfusion_interrelations\" : \"\n For a better understanding of the ventilation-perfusion interrelations, one must know about the three zones (not lobes) of the lung, their pressures, and the difference of ventilation and perfusion in each lung zone.\n\n - Lung zone 1: this lung zone experiences the lowest blood flow and ventilation but shows the highest alveolar pressure given the act of gravitational effects, the gravity pulls on the blood to reach lower zones but air is highly accumulated in the alveoli which increases their size thus increasing the alveolar pressure (pA) and decreasing the surface area. Since lower amounts of blood flow through the capillaries of the first zone (capillaries compressed by alveoli and less blood due to gravity) this renders the arterial pressure (Pa) of these vessels lowest among the other zones. With the alveoli having a larger diameter and a diminishing surface area, this phenomenon compresses the surrounding capillaries and so minimal perfusion occurs along with lowest ventilation levels (lesser surface area) creating a physiological dead space (highest ventilation-perfusion ratio) where then blood is shunted to other well perfused and ventilated areas.\n\n - Lung zone 2: the alveolar and arterial pressures are almost equal with arterial pressure being slightly higher, this promotes an environment of optimum perfusion giving the second zone of the lung the best ventilation perfusion ratio than the other zones.\n\n - Lung zone 3: this lung exhibits the lowest ventilation perfusion ratio as it has the lowest alveolar pressure, the highest ventilation along with the highest perfusion. The lowest alveolar pressure indicates that the alveoli are minimally inflated but the arterial pressure is high which is indicative of higher perfusion than the other lung zones therefore with higher perfusion comes higher ventilation due to the fact that smaller alveoli provide a larger surface area for gas exchange.\n\n - Low ventilation-perfusion ratio: seen in lung zone 3, simply means low ventilation compared to increased blood flow, whatever the underlying cause resulting in low perfusion might be. At a ratio as such, blood within the capillaries has relatively low oxygen saturation and partial pressure contrary to the partial pressure of CO2.\n\n - High ventilation-perfusion ratio: seen in lung zone 1, simply means higher ventilation compared to less blood flow (although ventilation is low in zone 1 but perfusion is even lower), whatever the underlying cause resulting in low perfusion might be. At a ratio as such, the blood within the capillaries has relatively high oxygen saturation and partial pressure contrary to the partial pressure of CO2.\n\n\"",
      "\"description_parathyroid_gland_hormone\" : \"\n Parathyroid is the body's main regulator of calcium, that is, it is concerned with the release and absorption of calcium from the bones, kidneys, and the gastrointestinal tract. The parathyroid hormone is released whenever the body is in a state of hypocalcemia in order to restore normal calcium levels.\n\n - Synthesis of parathyroid hormone: when calcium levels are low, the calcium sensitive receptors of the parathyroid gland are vacant and this receptor vacancy stimulates a series of intracellular reaction in the chief cells of the parathyroid gland where the end result of these reactions is forming intracellular parathyroid (PTH) containing vesicles whom contents are released out of the cell via exocytosis.\n\n - Mechanism of action of PTH:\n \u25cf Bones: when calcium blood levels are low and parathyroid hormone is secreted, it binds to the osteoblast cells since they are the only ones in the bone are equipped with the parathyroid hormone receptors. Upon binding, parathyroid hormone initiates a series of intracellular reactions via the adenylyl cyclase pathway with an end result of releasing RANK-ligand out of the osteoblast. The RANK-ligand chemical then binds to osteoclasts via the RANK receptor, this chemical results in stimulation and maturation where the activated osteoclasts go on about their function of bone resorption via their acids and enzymes thus releasing the stored calcium and phosphate into the blood.\n\n \u25cf Kidney: the parathyroid hormone exerts its action over the cells of the distal convoluted tubule and the collecting ducts that upon binding to the extracellular G-coupled receptor it initiates the intracellular adenylyl cyclase pathway with an end result of calcium channel over expression allowing calcium to pass from the lumen of the ducts and into the cell. Calcium then leaves the cell via a sodium-calcium ATPase counter transport channel and to the bloodstream but while calcium is absorbed parathyroid hormone also results in the excretion of phosphate in urine.\n\n \u25cf Gastrointestinal tract: via an indirect pathway that utilized vitamin D, calcium is absorbed from the intestine and into the blood stream where this mechanism is carried out through the synthesis of vitamin D and the action exerted by the latter on the intestine for calcium absorption.\n\n \u2713 The skin contains a substance called 7-dehydrocholesterol that is when struck by ultra-violet rays of the sun turns to cholecalciferol, cholecalcifiron travels via the blood stream to the liver where the enzyme 25-hydroxylase converts it to 25-hydroxy-cholecalciferol, the latter travels to the kidney where it undergoes another enzymatic modification of its structure via 1-alpha-hydroxylase (this enzyme is activated and up-regulated by parathyroid hormone) to eventually become 1,25-hydroxy-cholecalciferol that is the active form of vitamin D. The active vitamin D travels to the intestinal cells resulting in the over expression of the intracellular calcium binding protein called calbindin, this protein aggregates a number of calcium ions on to it and travels into the blood stream.\n\n - Calcitonin: is released by the parafollicular cells of the thyroid gland in response to increased calcium blood levels. Calcitonin does not increase calcium absorption from the blood but rather it inhibits osteoclasts and so the active osteoblasts will deposit the excess calcium into the bone.\n\n\"",

      "\"description_intercourse_physiology\" : \"\n Successful intercourse depends on an appropriate intensity of arousal that is able to initiate and maintain the sexual act. Psychological and physiological stimuli are considered two of the main driving factors to initiate arousal by thought or by touch and both factors are applicable to males and females equally as there is not much of a difference in the mechanism of arousal between both sexes.\n\n The psychological stimulation consists of a thought, an image, or a voice that is perceived by the individual as a sex-stimulating factor where as the physiological stimulation is the massaging of ones genitalia or perineum to the extent of eliciting an arousal.\n \u2713 The sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system are the main constituents of driving the process of arousal.\n\n - Male arousal and intercourse:\n \u25cf had arousal occurred by a psychological or physiological stimulus, the parasympathetic division integrated in the sacral segment of the spinal cord conduct its signals along the nerves length where at the nerve endings it would stimulate the release of vaso-dilating chemicals such as acetylcholine and nitric oxide causing dilation of the blood vessels in the erectile tissue of the penis.\n\n \u25cf As sexual intensity peaks during the act of intercourse, the sympathetic division integrated in the lumbar segments L1 and L2 of the spinal cord begin to conduct signals along the length of the pudendal nerve to build up for emission and ejaculation.\n\n \u25cf First, emission occurs as a results of contraction of the reproductive organs that are adding their respective fluids to the collection of sperm cells thereby creating what is known as semen, this addition of fluids advances the sperm cells further down the tract just behind the internal urethral sphincter.\n\n \u25cf Once the space posterior to the internal urethral sphincter is filled, the pudendal nerve sends out contraction signals to the muscles of the pelvic floor specifically ischiocavernosus and bulbocavernosus so both muscles contract and expel/ejaculate the semen outside the penis.\n\n - Female arousal and intercourse:\n \u25cf Had arousal occurred by a psychological or physiological stimulus, the parasympathetic division integrated in the sacral segment of the spinal cord conduct its signals along the nerves length where at the nerve endings it would stimulate the release of vaso-dilating chemicals such as acetylcholine and nitric oxide causing dilation of the blood vessels in the erectile tissue of the clitoris.\n\n \u25cf Once the erectile tissue filled with arterial blood, the muscles surrounding the vaginal orifice contract forming a tight grip around the penetrating penis.\n\n \u25cf Upon stimulation by the parasympathetic division, the bartholin gland secretes a lubricating mucus that allows for a smoother inward-withdraw action for the penis.\n\n \u25cf As sexual intensity peaks during the act of intercourse, the sympathetic division integrated in the lumbar segments L1 and L2 of the spinal cord begin to conduct signals along the length of the pudendal nerve to build up for ejaculation of the female semen from skene's gland (analogue of the male prostate).\n\n \u2713 The fertility window is the time where females are most fertile and that is three days before ovulation and two days after, so in a 28-day menstrual cycle, ovulation occurs at day 14 which makes the fertility window on days 11, 12, and 13 while also after ovulation a female remains fertile for days 15 and 16.

      "\"description_proximal_convoluted_tubule\" : \"\n The proximal convoluted tubule is the first phase of reabsorption after glomerular filtration as the this part of the tubular apparatus is mainly concerned with reabsorption.\n\n \u2713 The simple cuboidal epithelial cells of the proximal convoluted tubule are equipped with exchange gates on their luminal side (facing the lumen of the tubule) and on their basolateral side (facing the peritubular capillaries; i.e blood compartment).\n\n - Luminal exchange gates of the proximal convoluted tubule:\n \u25cf Sodium-glucouse transport gate (SGLT): sodium and glucose are co-transported through the membrane into the cell as sodium is moving down its electrochemical gradient (the electrochemical gradient is created on the basolateral surface) being coupled with glucose, this gate is supported by an electrochemical gradient and not by ATP.\n\n \u25cf Sodium-aminoacid transport gate: sodium and aminoacid are co-transported through the membrane into the cell as sodium is moving down its electrochemical gradient (the electrochemical gradient is created on the basolateral surface) being coupled with aminoacid, this gate is supported by an electrochemical gradient and not by ATP.\n\n \u25cf Sodium-phosphate transport gate: sodium and phosphate are co-transported through the membrane into the cell as sodium is moving down its electrochemical gradient (the electrochemical gradient is created on the basolateral surface) being coupled with phosphate, this gate is supported by an electrochemical gradient and not by ATP.\n\n \u25cf Sodium-hydrogen exchange gate: this is a counter transport exchange gate where sodium moves through the gate and into the cell while hydrogen moves through the membrane and out of the cell into the lumen. Once present in the lumen, the hydrogen proton bonds with filtered bicarbonate to form carbonic acid, the latter is then broken down to carbon dioxide and water then both passively diffuse into the cell.\n\n - Basolateral exchange gates:\n \u25cf Sodium-potassium ATPase pump: this exchange gate is powered by ATP for its functioning, it is a counterport pump where sodium moves out of the cell into the blood and potassium moves out of the blood into the cell. This pump ejects two sodium ions out of the cell while bringing in three potassium ions thus creating a sodium electrochemical gradient that is being utilized by the luminal gates.\n\n \u25cf Glucose gates: these glucose ports release glucose out of the cell and into the blood passively with out being coupled by other elements.\n\n \u25cf Amino acids: these amino acid ports release glucose out of the cell and into the blood passively with out being coupled by other elements.\n\n \u25cf Phosphate: these phosphate ports release glucose out of the cell and into the blood passively with out being coupled by other elements.\n\n \u25cf Bicarbonate: these bicarbonate ports release glucose out of the cell and into the blood passively with out being coupled by other elements. the bicarbonate released into the basolateral compartment is produced with the cell, recall earlier in this section we mentioned carbon dioxide and water diffuse passively into the cell. Within the cell, they join one another to form carbonic acid which is then broken down by the enzyme carbonic anhydrase into bicarbonate and a hydrogen proton where the hydrogen proton is transported to the luminal compartment through the sodium-hydrogen counterport gate and the bicarbonate is diffused passively into the basolateral compartment.\n\n \u2713 Chloride-formate exchange gate: located on the luminal compartment of the late proximal convoluted tubule as the early proximal convoluted tubule predominantly absorbs sodium, the late proximal tubule predominantly absorbs chloride via the chloride-formate exchange where chloride is transported through the luminal membrane into the cell in exchange of formate which is expelled out of the cell. On the basolateral compartment of the late proximal convoluted tubule lies the sodium-potassium ATPase pump (functions as that of the early proximal convoluted tubule) but as for calcium it diffuses passively into the blood.\n\n\"",

The anterior surface also shows the coracoid process which lies supero-laterally, it appears as a hook-shaped bony projection and serves as a point of attachment for several muscles.\n\n \u25cf Posterior surface of the scapula: it is characterized by a bony prominence running obliquely from the medial border to the lateral border of the scapula at the superior one-third part of the scapula.

      "\"description_female_menstruation\" : \"\n Menstruation is a monthly occurring process with varying lengths of the duration with respect to recurrence (most women report menstruation every 28 days) and lasting on average for 3-7 days.\n\n Menstruation first occurs with development of an ovarian follicle and the ovum it contains within it, once development reaches its end point, the ovum is released from the follicle into the reproductive tract. During this time the uterus is being prepared for a possible implantation of a fertilized ovum as its cells begin to proliferate and its glands start to develop in order to provide nourishment for the fertilized ovum if implantation does occur. If ovum is not fertilized and implantation has not occurred the proliferated uterine lining starts to shed thus marking the end of the menstrual cycle and the onset of menses.\n\n - Stages of the menstrual cycle:\n \u25cf Follicular/proliferative stage: takes place at the first day of menses of the previous menstrual cycle where the follicle stimulating hormone acts upon a unique ovarian follicle called the primordial follicle which houses the oocyte to further manifest its development and while this follicle is being developed, the surrounding ovarian follicles degenerate thus making it the dominant follicle. Estrogen and estradiol are secreted in abundance during this stage to establish endothelial proliferation of the uterine lining and angiogenesis to provide a strong and thick endometrium if implantation were to occur. This phase's duration has no constant timing and its duration range can vary but on average it spans over 14 days after menses from the previous cycle.\n\n \u25cf Ovulation: leutinizing hormone is what causes the dominant follicle to ovulate and release its oocyte into the fallopian tube. During the last few days of the follicular stage, a surge of FSH and LH takes place providing ultimate development of the follicle and expulsion of the matured oocyte from the follicle respectively. The developing and previously developed glands of the uterus and cervix secreted a type of mucus that is this in density and watery in consistency in order to provide a smoother passage for sperm cells during their journey up the female reproductive tract.\n\n \u25cf Luteal/secretory stage: occurs just after ovulation where the dominant follicle then regresses and becomes the corpus luteum, a hormone releasing body. Stimulated by the luteinizing hormone, the corpus luteum secretes progesterone and estrogen for further development of the uterine lining. The progesterone is responsible for the building and maturation of the endometrial glands in addition to formation of more blood vessels that support those glands and their secretory mechanisms. The luteinizing hormone is responsible for further development of the endothelial and stromal cells in addition to the formation of blood vessels that support their rapid growth.\n\n \u25cf Menses: is the shedding of the grown endometrial lining of the uterus due to the marked decrease in estrogen and progesterone hormone levels resulting from the degeneration of the corpus luteum. The corpus luteum becomes the main secretory organ post-ovulation and when fertilization/implantation fails to occur this secretory organ degenerates an lesser hormones are released. The growing endometrium sheds because of the vaso-spastic activity of the associated blood vessels that occurs due to the decreased hormone levels rendering the endometrial lining necrotic as the thickness of the lining cannot be nourished by the decreased blood supply.\n\n\"",
      "\"description_large_intestine_motility\" : \"\n The large intestine functions in mixing, absorbing, and propelling the contents with in it that are called feces.\n\n - Mixing of feces: this process takes place with in the ascending and proximal transverse colon where due to the distention of the walls, the mechanoreceptors stimulate the myenteric plexus to carry out stimulatory impulses to the circular muscles this causes constricting contractions that drastically decrease the diameter of the colon along a lengthy distance from the point of the distention, simultaneously the longitudinal muscles of the colon also contract to shorten the length of the colon. Such a combination of strong contractions gives the large intestine a significant appearance of what has been described as sac-like spaces called haustrations. These contractions are generated once every ninety seconds and last for thirty seconds.\n\n - Absorption: is a process occurring in the distal colon and since feces travel slowly through, it provides optimum absorption of liquids from the colon content that turns the feces to semi-solid texture (see GIT physiology - absorption of the alimentary canal section).\n\n - Propulsion: a process occurring along the entire length of the colon occurring at a rate estimated to be 1-3 times per day (the contractions are uncountable but have been identified to have a frequency of occurrence up to 1-3 times per day). These movements consist of strong peristaltic contractions that result from distention at one point of the colon which is sensed by mechanoreceptors that activate the myenteric plexus to send stimulatory impulses to both the circular and longitudinal muscles. As the contractions synchronize, they occur along a lengthy distance from the point of the distention causing the colon to lose the characteristic haustrations.\n\n - Defecation: is the expelling of feces through the anus to the outside of the body. Once the rectum is stuffed with feces the rectal walls dilate thus eliciting a counter-contraction, these contractions open the internal anal sphincter so the feces pass into the anal canal where the it remains in the anal vault, since the external anal sphincter is a voluntarily controlled skeletal muscle, once convenient defecation can take place.\n\n\"",

In this section we will be listing the different parts of the nephrones and in the following sections we will be thoroughly discussing each part.\n\n \u2713 The nephrone consists of two compartments, a vascular and a tubular compartments.\n\n - Vascular compartment of the nephrone:\n \u25cf Afferent arteriole: is the arteriole carrying the blood supply from the interlobular arteries and into the glomerulus.\n\n \u25cf Glomerulus: is a collection of intervening capillaries, also described as a tuft of capillaries, with a widely spaced endothelium that allow substances to move out of the capillary tuft and into the glomerular capsule.\n\n \u25cf Efferent arteriole: is the arteriole carrying blood away from the glomerulus after it has been ultra-filtered and cleared from metabolic by-products, the efferent arterioles carry the blood to the peritubular capillaries.\n\n \u25cf Peritubular capillaries: as the name suggests, the peritubular capillaries is a series of capillary network surrounding the tubules of the nephrone, they function in the absorption of nutrients and secretion of metabolic wastes.\n\n - Tubular compartment of the nephrone:\n \u25cf Glomerular capsule: is a three-layer sac-like structure where part of the capsule facing the tuft of capillaries is lined by podocytes that function in selective filtration and the outer layer of the capsule is lined by the delicate squamous cell epithelium, as for the space in between both cell layers is called the glomerular space and it is where the ultra-filtrate of the glomerulus empties into.\n\n \u25cf Proximal convoluted tubule: is the first tubule receiving the ultra-filtrate from the glomerular capsule and is lined by simple cuboidal epithelium.\n\n \u25cf Loop of henle: consists of a thin descending tubule, a thin ascending tubule, and a thick ascending tubule. Those three tubules are all lined by simple squamous epithelium that are highly selective in absorption and secretion.\n\n \u25cf Distal convoluted tubule: is the fifth and last part of the tubular compartment of the nephrone and like the proximal convoluted tubule it is lined by simple cuboidal epithelium.\n\n \u2713 The glomerular basement membrane which lies between the endothelial simple squamous cells of the glomerulus and the podocytes of the glomerular capsule plays a crucial role in filtration. The membrane is a three-layer structure consisting of lamina rara interna which lies just beyond the glomerular endothelium and is made out of proteoglycans (heparan sulfate), then is the lamina densa which is made out of type four collagen, and beneath that lies another layer of proteoglycans (heparan sulfate) called the lamina rara externa as is just above the podocytes.\n\n\"",
      "\"description_cerebellum1\" : \"\n The cerebellum grossly appears as an ovoid structure showing two cerebellar hemispheres that are joined together at the midline by the vermis and is connected to the posterior aspect of the brainstem by the superior, middle and inferior peduncles. the cerebellum consists of three lobes (and seven lobules) the anterior lobe which lies in the superior surface of the cerebellum and is separated from the middle lobe by the primary fissure, the middle lobe (also called the posterior lobe) which lies between the primary and the uvulo-nodular fissure, the flocculo-nodular lobe which lies posterior to the uvulo-nodular fissure.\n\n Organization of the cerebellar cortex: an outer covering of gray matter and an inner composition of white matter that contains the intracerebellar nuclei (three masses of gray matter embedded in the cerebellar white matter).\n\n Organization of the cerebellum: as we mentioned earlier the cerebellum is formed of white matter and is thrown in to folds on the interior and covered with gray matter on the exterior. The gray matter consists of three layers;\n the external molecular layer which contains the outer stellate and inner basket cells, the middle purkinje cell layer, and the lower granular layer.\n\n Functional areas in the cerebellar cortex: the vermis affects movement of the thorax, abdomen, shoulders, neck, and hips. The intermediate zone (lateral to the vermis) affects the movement of hands and feet. The lateral zone of the cerebellar hemispheres affect conscious movement of the entire body.\n\n\"",
      "\"description_anterior_pituitary_gland\" : \"\n The anterior pituitary gland is the most important gland of the body attributed to by the functions of the hormones the gland releases, they are growth hormone, thyroid stimulating hormone, follicle stimulating hormone, leutinizing hormone, adreno-corticotropic hormone, and prolactin.\n\n - Growth hormone: is released from the anterior pituitary gland's somatotrope cells upon stimulation by the growth hormone releasing hormone that is secreted from the hypothalamus. Upon its secretion growth hormone travels along the blood stream either freely or bound to growth hormone binding proteins where it is destined to bind with the liver receptors or reach one of its numerous serving organs.\n\n \u25cf Mechanism of action of growth hormone: the majority of actions carried out by growth hormone are via a protein called insulin-like growth factor type 1 (IGF-1) and other functions are carried out directly by growth hormone. The synthesis of IGF-1 occurs in the liver where growth hormone bind to the extracellular JAK/tyrosine kinase receptor, the activation of this receptor produces a series of intracellular and intranuclear reactions that eventually form the IGF-1 hormone which is then released out of the liver and into the blood stream via exocytosis. When acting on its target organs, growth hormone also utilizes the JAK/tyrosine kinase receptor pathway.\n\n \u25cf Functions of IGF-1:\n \u2022 Muscles: IGF-1 binds to the extracellular JAK/tyrosine kinase receptor and upon its activation, a series of intracellular and intranuclear reactions ensue. These reactions result in the increase of intra-skeletal proteins and open protein channels on the extracellular membrane for more amino acid influx thus producing muscle hypertrophy.\n\n \u2022 Bones: with IGF-1 binding to the JAK/tyrosine kinase receptors on the bone's extracellular surface, the resulting receptor activation and the following series of intracellular and intranuclear reactions stimulate osteoclasts and osteoblasts for bone resorption and formation respectively where the on-off effect of osteoclasts and osteoblasts results in bone remodelling and endo-chondral ossification thereby increasing both width and length of the bone. IGF-1 results in over production of collagen type one and proteoglycans thereby further strengthening the bone. IGF-1 acts upon the cartilagenous epishyseal plates of the bones and its chondrocytes resulting in hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the chondrocytes, this enables the epiphyseal plates to grow thereby increasing bone length along with it in a process called interstitial bone growth.\n\n - Functions of growth hormone:\n \u25cf Adipose tissue: upon binding to and activating the JAK/tyrosine kinase receptors of the adipose tissue, growth hormone activates an intracellular enzyme called hormone sensitive lipase which is responsible for the break down of triglycerides into fatty acids and glycerol through the process of lipolysis.\n\n \u25cf Muscles: growth hormone binds to the extracellular JAK/tyrosine kinase receptor on the extracellular surface of muscles and stimulate the opening of the amino acid channels thus increasing protein uptake by the muscles.\n\n \u25cf Liver: growth hormone is able to initiate the process of gluconeogenesis in the liver through the utilization of glycerol which is one of the two products of triglyceride break down.\n\n \u25cf Glucose uptake: growth hormone is able to block glucose uptake by physiologically antagonising insulin and exerting a counter insulin effect by producing configurational changes in extracellular glucose receptors or actively inhibiting insulin receptors.\n\n \u2713 LH, FSH, and prolactin hormones are discussed in physiology of reproduction - female androgens and ACTH hormone is discussed in the section of adrenal gland hormones and thyroid stimulating hormone is discussed in the section of thyroid gland hormones.\n\n\"",

It presents with bladder fullness, frequency, urgency, difficulty initiating urine stream, and weak urine stream. This condition is diagnosed by urine analysis, bladder stress test and ultrasound of the urinary bladder. Management of this condition includes treatment directed towards the underlying cause.\n\n \u25cf Urgency incontinence: is a condition characterized by leak of urine with the sudden sensation of wanting to void. It results from an overactive urinary bladder that contracts more than its normal contraction rate leading to multiple episodes of voiding. It presents with frequency, urgency, and dribbling of urine before voiding. This condition is diagnosed by urine analysis, ultrasound of the bladder, and urodynamic testing. Management of this condition includes oxybutynin and mirabegron.\n\n \u25cf Stress incontinence: is a condition characterized by the leaking of urine upon increased Intra-abdominal pressure (laughing, coughing, or valsalva maneuver).

When movement stops or is about to stop, the endolymph then begins to move inorder to bring the hair cells to the opposite direction (depolarize the hyperpolarized cilia and hyperpolarize the depolarized cilia).\n\n \u2713 After the generation of the action potential, the impulses travel along the vestibular nerve which ascends to terminate into the vestibular nuclei of the medulla. The medial vestibular nuclei receives input from the semi-circular canal, the superior vestibular nuclei receives input from the semi-circular canal, the lateral vestibular nuclei receives input from the utricle, the inferior vestibular canal receives input from the saccule, utricle, and semi-circular canal. The medial, superior, and inferior vestibular nuclei also function in eye movement as they contribute to the innervation of the extra-occular muscles, meanwhile the lateral vestibular nuclei aids in maintaining axial and peripheral postural reflexes.\n\n\"",

      "\"description_red_cell_formation\" : \"\n The red blood cells are produced in the bone marrow via the process of erythropoiesis. The red blood cells are from the myeloid lineage of blood cells that is produced by the pluripotent hematopoietic stem cell which divides into lymphoid stem cells (produces T-cells and B-cells of the immune system; lymphoid lineage) and colony stimulating unit-Spleen (produces the RBCs, WBCs and platelets; myeloid lineage).\n\n Steps of RBC lineage differentiation:\n \u25cf Pluripotent hematopoietic stem cell: this type of cell giving rise to the progenitor cells that later differentiate into specific blood cells. Influenced by the granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor and the stem cell factor along with interleukin-1, 3, and 6, it gives rise to the myeloid progenitor cell.\n\n \u25cf Pro-erythroblast: is the first differentiation of the myeloid progenitor cell into a red blood cell, when the myeloid cell is exposed to erythropoietin it converts to pro-erythroblast.\n\n \u25cf Basophil erythroblast: is the second differentiated cell of the erythrocyte lineage and is formed when stem cell factor and erythropoietin bind to the proerythroblast resulting in its differentiation.\n\n \u25cf Polychromatophil erythroblast: is the third cellular differentiation in the red blood cell lineage from the myeloid progenitor cell, it is formed when the basophil erythroblast is exposed to interleukin-3 and erythropoeiten.\n\n \u25cf Orthochromic erythroblast: is the fourthly differentiated cell of the myeloid progenitor cell of the RBC lineage, it is formed when the polychromatophil erythroblast is exposed to interleukin-6 and eryhtropoiten.\n\n \u25cf Reticulocyte: this cell is the last of the RBC lineage that forms in the bone marrow and it arises from othrochromatic erythroblasts where solely eryhtropoietin acts on the erythroblast to result in its differentiation to reticulocyte.\n\n \u25cf Erythrocyte: is the final and mature form of RBCs where most organells of the immature reticulocyte has been absorbed or extruded due to the binding of granulocyte colony stimulating factor and erythopoietin which results in the maturation of the reticulocyte cell into a functionally mature erythrocyte (a process occurring outside the bone marrow).\n\n - Erythropoietin and RBC production: erythropietin is the main chemical responsible for RBC differentiation and maturation, it is a glycoprotein dominantly produced by the kidneys in cases of hypovolemia, hypoxia, and low blood pressure. The kidneys sense the decrease in blood volume or oxygen volume and are stimulated by their baro-receptors and chemo-receptors to modulate the abnormality and so they secrete erythropoietin to increase the production of RBCs, this results in increased blood viscosity and more oxygen utilization.\n\n\"",

      "\"description_gallbladder_secretions\" : \"\n The gallbladder functions in the storage and secretion of bile but it does not have a role in bile formation, bile salts are categorized as primary (formed in the liver) and secondary (altered by intestinal microbes).\n\n - Components of bile: bile primarily consists of bile salts, phospholipids, water, bilirubin, cholesterol, sodium, bicarbonate, and chloride.\n\n - Bile salt production:\n \u25cf Cholesterol (in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum) is converted into 7-alpha-hydroxycholesterol by 7-alphahydroxylase (the classic pathway) and 27-hydroxycholesterol (the alternative pathway).\n\n \u25cf After a series of complicated (low-yield) reactions, the end products are bile acids cholic and chenodeoxycholic acid.\n\n \u25cf Those two compounds can either enter the bile ducts and travel to the intestine to be modified by the intestinal bacteria to become secondary bile acids or are conjugated by aminoacid addition of glycine and taurine so the acids are polarized and converted into salts thus becoming more water soluble.\n\n - Biliary phospholipids: are phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin, both function in protecting the intestinal wall and the gallbladder from the precipitation and crystalization of bile salts.\n\n - Bilirubin: the product of heme degradation that occurs within the spleen, bilirubin gives bile its distinct color.\n\n - Bile secretion: once lipids are present in the duodenum, this stimulates the I-cells of the small intestine to release cholecystokinin (CCK) which then acts on the gallbladder and the sphincter of oddi resulting in periodic contractions of the gallbladder and simultaneous relaxation of the oddi sphincter. Bile is secreted in periodic spurts in accordance to intestinal peristalsis, when peristalsis occurs it increases the intra-luminal pressure of the intestine which inhibits the secretion of bile and once peristalsis ceases secretion begins.\n\n - Emulsification process of bile: being a hydrophobic substance, fat does not mix with the chyme instead it forms globules since chyme is predominantly made out of water therefore bile salts which are amphipathic in nature (soluble in fat and water) are brought in to emulsify the fats. Emulsification is the process of dispersing two compounds into one another with out mixing their molecules, bile salts breakdown the fat globules into lipid droplets thus increases the surface area of the lipids by dispersing it into the chyme where lipase enzymes can breakdown fat more easily. Pancreatic lipase and colipase bind to the lipids to form a micelle which is a spherical object containing a hydrophobic core of fat and the hydrophobic surface of bile salts and an outer hydrophilic surface that is dispersed within the chyme, those micelles then bind to the villi for absorption.\n\n\"",

Pro-thrombin, a circulating clotting protein factor is activated upon vessel injury by the prothrombin activator with aid of a calcium ion to thrombin, thrombin then converts fibrinogen (a circulating clotting protein) into fibrin and with the aid of a calcium ion the fibrin takes the shape of fibers and forms a mesh around the platelets to fixate and strengthen their inter-bondage.\n\n \u25cf Formation of the blood clot: a blood clot consists of a platelet plug, fibrin mesh, and entrapped blood cells and a blood cloot forms by one of two different processes called the intrinsic and extrinsic pathway.\n\n \u2022 Intrinsic pathway: is the pathway responsible for achieving hemostasis in cases of intravascular trauma where the collagen fibers of the blood vessel wall are exposed to the lumen of the vessel and that the coagulation proteins of this pathway are present in the plasma hence they are intravascular (intrinsic; i.e intravascular). First, the circulating coagulation factor12 is activated in response to intravascular injury to factor12-A (activated factor12), then the activated factor12 with the aid of fletcher factor turn factor-11 to activated factor11 (factor11-A), then factor11-A with the aid of a calcium ion and factor-8 (not yet an active factor; factor8-a) turns factor-9 to factor9-A, then thrombin activates factor-8 to factor8-A and with the aid of both a calcium ion and factor9-A they activate factor-10 into factor10-A, where eventually factor10-A with the aid of a calcium ion, factor5 (non-activated form), and thrombin, result in the production of the prothrombin factor that contributes to the formation of the fibrin mesh.\n\n \u2022 Extrinsic pathway: is the pathway responsible for achieving hemostasis in cases of extravascular trauma where the tissues of the body are injured and release the tissue factor that attracts the extravascular coagulation proteins. Upon tissue injury, the cells damages release a substance called the tissue factor which attracts the extravascular coagulation protein factor-7 and converts it to its active for factor7-A, then factor7-A converts factor-10 with the aid of a calcium ion to factor10-A, and eventually factor10-A with the aid of a calcium ion and the non-active factor5 create the extravascular prothrombin activator that contributes to the formation of the fibrin mesh.\n\n\"",

      "\"description_anatomy_large_intestine\" : \"\n the large intestine begins at the ileocecal valve, its first part begins at the right iliac region and ascends through the right lumbar and right hypochondrium region, in the right hypochondrium it curves and transversely crosses to the left side of the body by running through the epigastric and left hypochondrium regions, it then curves to descend through the left lumbar region and left iliac region, at the left iliac region it crosses to the hypogastric region at the midline.\n\n - The large intestine is divided into six parts:\n \u25cf The cecum: is the dilated blind-ending pouch of the large intestine that lies below the opening of the ileocecal valve in the right iliac region of the abdomen. The appendix, a worm-like structure that mostly lies behind the cecum is seen suspending from the cecum containing a huge amount of lymphoid aggregates therefore an inflamed appendix is indeed troublesome. the cecum and the appendix are intraperitoneal structures.\n\n \u25cf The ascending colon: it has a diameter smaller than that of the cecum and ascends through the left lumbar and left hypochondrium regions of the abdomen. In the left hypochondrium the ascending colon curves giving off the hepatic colic flexure and continues to become the transverse colon. The ascending colon is covered anteriorly and laterally by the peritoneum but its posterior surface lacks the peritoneal covering and thus is considered to be a retroperitoneal organ.\n\n \u25cf The transverse colon: it begins at the hepatic colic flexure and runs transversely to left side of the body ending at the left hypochondrium region of the abdomen where it curves downward giving off the splenic colic flexure and continues to become the descending colon. The descending colon is covered entirely by peritoneum, posteriorly by the peritoneum of the posterior abdominal wall and anteriorly by the greater omentum.\n\n \u25cf The descending colon: begins at the splenic colic flexure and descends through the left lumbar and the left iliac regions of the abdomen where it then would cross to the hypogastric region and continue as the sigmoid colon. The descending colon is a retroperitoneal structures.\n\n \u25cf The sigmoid colon: lies at the hypogastric region of the abdomen, it is the continuation of the descending colon as it crosses to the midline. In the hypogastric region the sigmoid colon descends into the pelvic inlet and lies in line with the pubic symphysis to terminate into becoming the rectum. The sigmoid colon is covered entirely by peritoneum.\n\n \u25cf The rectum: levels with the S3 vertebra, it is covered by a muscular coat and descends to eventually becoming the anus, however, the rectum does not descend in a linear fashion but is seen to be giving two curves a left and a right. These curves are due to the transverse folds of the rectum that aid in accommodation of feces and slow its propagation to the anus. But before its termination, the rectum shows a dilation called the ampulla and this dilatation helps in storing feces.\n\n \u25cf Anal canal: it lies at the anal triangle of the perineum, it allows feces to pass through the anal canal and to the outside. The anal canal is special in that it has two sphincters (valves) and internal and an external anal sphincter.

It presents with lightheadedness, fatigue, shortness of breath and dizziness upon exertion, pallor of skin and mucous membrane, brittle nails and hair, heavy menstrual bleeding (can be the primary cause of iron deficiency anemia). This condition is diagnosed by blood tests for CBC, hemoglobin (9mg and below), low ferritin (30mcg/L and below), high total iron binding capacity (below 250mcg/dL), high transferrin (380mg/dL or more), MCV (mean corpuscle volume) below 80, high RDW (15 percent or higher), and peripheral blood smear showing the characteristic small and pale (i.e microcytic and hypochromic) red blood cells. Management of this condition includes treatment directed towards the underlying cause and ferrous sulfate.\n\n \u25cf Alpha Thalassemia: is a condition of genetic mutation and deletion (autosomal recessive) of the alpha gene on chromosome 16 characterized by a defective or reduced production of the alpha-globin chains which results in the formation of a defective hemoglobin. As a result, beta chains predominate and form beta-tetramers that precipitate as inclusion bodies in the RBCs resulting in increased red cell destruction by the spleen and hemolysis. It presents with signs and symptoms of iron deficiency anemia along with splenomegaly, jaundice (indirect bilirubin from hemolysis), and fetal hydrops. This condition is diagnosed by blood tests for CBC, iron profile (MCV lower than 80), hemoglobin electrophoresis, Reticulocyte count, LDH, Haptoglobin, peripheral blood smear, and targeted gene deletion analysis. Management of this condition includes blood transfusion (be aware of iron overload), deferoxamine for iron chelation, and splenectomy.\n\n \u25cf Beta-thalassemia: is a condition of genetic point mutation (autosomal recessive) characterized by defective or reduced formation of beta-globin chains. As a result, alpha chains predominate and accumulate in the bone marrow as inclusion bodies that result in marrow expansion. The red cells loose integrity and become prone to rupture with increased breakdown by spleen. It presents with signs and symptoms similar to iron deficiency anemia along with hepatosplenomegaly, failure to thrive, frontal bossing, maxillary protrusion, and nasal bridge depression. This condition is diagnosed by blood tests for CBC, iron profile (MCV lower than 80), hemoglobin electrophoresis, Reticulocyte count, LDH, Haptoglobin, and Peripheral blood smear (shows characteristic target cells, nucleated RBCs, hypochromic microcytic RBCs, and nucleated RBCs). Management of this condition includes blood transfusion and deferoxamine.\n\n \u25cf Sideroblastic anemia: is a condition of multiple etiologies (inherited, alcohol or lead poisoning, drugs such as chloramphenicol) characterized by defective heme synthesis that results in iron accumulation in the bone marrow and mitochondria of RBCs. As a result, the defective heme synthesis leads to iron-overload in the bone marrow and red blood cells where the latter shows a central nucleus (premature RBC) with peripheral iron inclusions. It presents with signs and symptoms similar to iron deficiency anemia, bronze skin from iron-overload, and hepatosplenomegaly. This condition is diagnosed by blood tests for CBC, iron profile (low MCV), lead levels, peripheral blood smear (microcytic hypochromic RBCs), and purssian stain (turns iron inclusions blue).

Management of this condition includes cyanocobalamin.\n\n \u2713 Hypothyroidism, chronic alcohol consumption, and alcoholic liver disease (less common is hepatitis-B cirrhosis) result in macrocytic hypochromic anemia with MCV higher than 100. The diagnosis of anemia in the mentioned pathologies involves similar investigations to those of iron defeciency anemia and the management is directed towards the underlying cause.\n\n - Sickle cell anemia: is a condition of autosomal recessive inheritance pattern characterized by defective hemoglobin (HbSS; homozygous) that results in the characteristic morphological red cell deformity (sickle-shaped). The morphologically ill RBCs are fragile and tend to rupture this rising a state of hemolysis and since they are of abnormal shape, they are consumed at a higher rate by the spleen. The deformed RBCs are notorious for clogging arteries resulting in distal profusion compromise characteristically known as vaso-occlusive crisis. It presents with symptoms similar to iron deficiency anemia along with jaundice, painful hepatosplenomegaly, dactylitis, priaposm, and recurrent periodic bouts of chest and abdominal pain (can also present with stroke). This condition is diagnosed by CBC, iron profile, Hemoglobin electrophoresis, Reticulocyte count, LDH, Haptoglobin, and peripheral blood smear. Management of this condition includes hydroxyurea, IV fluids, ibuprofen (codeine for sickle-cell crisis), heamophilus influenzae type B vaccine, meningococcal vaccine, and blood transfusion (vaso-occlusive crisis).\n\n - G6PD anemia: is a condition of X-linked recessive inheritance pattern characterized by lack of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase enzyme, a protective factor against oxidative stress. When exposed to oxidative stress via food (fava beans) or medications (particularly anti-malarial), the RBCs present with Heinz bodies (denatured hemoglobin) and rupture resulting in hemolytic anemia. It presents with jaundice, splenomegaly, dark urine, and pale stool. This condition is diagnosed by blood tests for CBC, iron profile, Hemoglobin electrophoresis, Reticulocyte count, LDH, Haptoglobin, and peripheral blood smear (bite cells; macrophages bite-off the heinz bodies from the RBCs). Management of this condition includes avoiding triggers and folate.\n\n - Auto-immune Hemolytic anemia: is a condition characterized by the destruction of red blood cells via auto-antibodies and is divided into two types, warm and cold hemolytic anemia.\n\n \u25cf Warm hemolytic anemia: occurs when the body is exposed to heat temperatures of 37 degree Celsius and above, mediated by IgG immunoglobulin while the direct cause of such reaction is yet to be determined. This results in RBC destruction in the spleen (extra-vascular hemolysis). It presents with symptoms similar to iron deficiency anemia along with the jaundice and splenomegaly. This condition is diagnosed by blood tests for CBC, iron profile, Hemoglobin electrophoresis, Reticulocyte count, LDH, Haptoglobin, coomb's test, and direct/indirect bilirubin levels. Management of this condition includes prednisone, splenectomy, and rituximab.\n\n \u25cf Cold hemolytic anemia: occurs when the body is exposed to temperatures of 4 degree Celsius or less, mediated by IgM immunoglobulin while the direct cause of such reaction is yet to be determined. IgM immunoglobulin results in intravascular hemolysis and the RBCs start to adhere with one another forming a clump. It presents with symptoms similar to iron deficiency anemia along with jaundice and hepatomegaly. This condition is diagnosed by blood tests for CBC, iron profile, Hemoglobin electrophoresis, Reticulocyte count, LDH, Haptoglobin, coomb's test, cold agglutinin titer, direct/indirect bilirubin levels. Management of this condition includes rituximab and fludarabine.\n\n - Polycythemia vera: is a condition characterized by JAK-2 gene mutation resulting in the malignant proliferation of hematopoietic progenitor cells which leading to increased red cell production along with white cells and platelets. The high RBC levels increase blood viscosity with sluggish flow through the circulation. It presents with dyspnea, facial redness, hypertension, dizziness, headaches, hepatosplenomegaly, increased itchiness, and increased bruising and bleeding tendency. This condition is diagnosed by increased Hemoglobin (16 and above), genetic analysis for JAK-2 mutation, and bone marrow biopsy showing proliferation of all cell lines.\n\n\"",

The liver is roofed by the diaphragm with its lateral surface facing ribs 5-10.\n\n The liver has two surfaces:\n \u25cf Diaphragmatic surface: is a smooth surface that is further divided into the anterior and superior surfaces. The anterior part of the liver faces the dorsal surface of the corresponding ribs and the diaphragm, and is seen divided into a large right lobe and a smaller left lobe by the falciform ligament (reflection of the peritoneum). The superior surface faces the diaphragm but it doesn't comes in contact with it as the subphrenic spaces/recess prohibits it from doing so (the subphrenic space is divided into right and left spaces by the falciform ligament).\n\n \u25cf Visceral surface: is also called the posterior surface of the liver and as its name suggests it lies in contact with a number of abdominal viscera (described later in this section).

Function of the primary motor area: by receiving input from the secondary motor area, sensory cortex, basal ganglia, sensory cortex and cerebellum it provides individual isolated movements on the opposite side of the body and also muscles responsible for specific movements. it is interesting to know that the movements of the body areas are represented from down upwards (motor homunculus of the precentral gyrus) where at the bottom are areas responsible for swallowing, larynx, tongue, jaw, lips, eyelid, eyebrow, and at the top are areas for the hip, knee (the area for the toes is located at the medial surface of the hemisphere in the paracentral lobule as well as the areas of the anal and vesical sphincters), and ankle while is the area between the top and bottom lies areas responsible for fingers, wrist, hand, elbow, shoulder and trunk.\n\n - Function of the secondary motor area: it receives input from the sensory cortex, basal ganglia and thalamus with its functions being storing motor activity from past experience, programs the activity of the primary motor area (as explained earlier), control coarse postural movements via its connections to the basal ganglia.\n\n - Function of supplementary motor area: responsible for movement of contralateral limbs.\n\n - Function of frontal eye field: when stimulated, it causes conjugate movement of the eye (predominantly to the opposite side) and voluntary scanning movements of the eye (independent of visual stimuli).\n\n -

The number of receptors in a certain area of the body defines the size of its designated cotical area. The afferent fibers entering the cortex stimulate the neurons in the fourth layer, as a result impulses travel to the upper and deeper layers of the cortex. however, from the sixth layers inhibitory fibers proceed to the sensory areas of the thalamus, medulla oblongata, and the spinal cord inorder to modulate the intensity of the sensory input.\n\n - Function of secondary somesthetic area: is yet to be determined but it is speculated to sense light upon cutaneous stimulation.\n\n - Function of somesthetic association area: it integrates different sensory inputs to come up with a single sensory conclusion (having an object in your hand with your eyes closed, this area helps you recognize what type of an object it is that you're holding).\n\n - Function of primary visual stimuli: it processes visual stimuli inorder to form a complete image. The visual cortex receives afferent fibers from the lateral geniculate body and these fibers pass to the white matter of the temporal lobe and eventually terminate in the visual cortex of the occipital lobe. It is important to understand that the retina has two fibers, an ipsilateral temporal and a contralateral nasal where the temporal is responsible for medial vision and the nasal is responsible for lateral vision.

The inner part then proceeds to form further modulation within the cell to deliver the activity desired by the ligand.\n\n - GABA-receptors: are receptors that respond to the chemical gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) which is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the CNS. The GABA receptors are classified into two groups, the GABA(A) receptors and GABA(B) receptors.\n\n \u25cf GABA(A) receptors: are ligand-gated ion channel receptors that are when activated by the binding of GABA they would cause calcium ion influx in the cell thus rendering the cell hyperpolarized and establishing inhibition of electrical impulse transmission.\n\n \u25cf GABA(B) receptors: is a G-protein coupled receptor that functions in delivering the inhibitory mechanism of GABA by causing potassium influx and inhibiting calcium influx along with deregulation of adenylyl cyclace which decreases the expression of cAMP in the cell, thus inhibiting the generation and further propagation of electrical impulse.\n\n - Acetycholine receptors: is a trans-membrane receptor that binds acetycholine which is the main excitatory neurotransmitter of skeletal muscles. Acetycholine receptors are divided into two groups, the nicotinic receptors and the muscarinic receptors.\n\n \u25cf Nicotinic receptors: are ion channel receptors that deliver the action intended by acetylcholine through directly acting on increasing the potassium efflux from within the cell and allowing sodium and calcium influx into the cell and resulting in depolarization thus generating an electrical impulse.\n\n \u25cf Muscarinic receptor: is a G-protein coupled receptor that delivers the stimulating action intended by acetycholine through a second messenger system where activation of the G-protein causes an upregulation in adenylyl cyclase and over expression of cAMP thus generating and electrical impulse within the cell. In the cardiac muscle however, the acetycholine binding to the G-protein coupled receptor results in upregulation of guanylate cyclase thus resulting in the down expression of cAMP, this causes a decrease in cardiac muscle activity and electrical impulse generation.\n\n - Glutamate receptors: they bind the main excitatory neurotransmitter in the CNS and consists of two types of receptors, the inotropic receptors and the G-protein coupled receptors.\n\n \u25cf Inotropic receptors: are ligand gated ion channels that upon binding of glutamate they would result in sodium influx to depolarize the cell and deliver the excitatory action intended by glutamate.\n\n \u25cf Metabotropic glutamate receptor type 1 (post-synaptic): it delivers the excitatory action of glutamate by activating the G-protein coupled receptor which in turn activates the enzyme phospholipase C (intracellulary), this results in upregulation of diacylglycerol and inositol triphosphate (IP3) causing over expression of protein kinase C thus inhibiting influx of potassium and increasing intracellular release of calcium, this causes depolarization of the cell and generation of an electrical impulse.\n\n \u25cf Metabotropic glutamate receptor type 2 (pre-synaptic): it functions uniquely in inhibiting glutamate pre-synaptically as its G-protein coupled receptor exhibits inhibitory elements thus when activated it would down regulate adenylyl cyclase and decrease the levels of cAMP thereby implementing its inhibitory mechanism.\n\n - Serotonin receptor (5-HT): are G-protein coupled receptors that exhibit both excitatory and inhibitory functions, they are of seven types.\n \u25cf Serotonin type one receptor: is a G-protein coupled receptor where the G-protein exhibits an inhibitory element thus when stimulated by serotonin it would down regulate adenylyl cyclase and decrease level of cAMP resulting in inhibition of electric impulse generation.\n\n \u25cf Serotonin type two receptor: the G-protein of this receptor exhibits an excitatory element therefore when stimulated it results in the up-regulation of diacylglycerol and inositol triphosphate which activates protein kinase C causing intracellular calcium influx thus generating and electrical impulse.\n\n \u25cf Serotonin receptor type 3: unlike the other types of serotonin receptors, it is a ligand gated ion channel receptor where its stimulation results in influx of sodium and efflux of potassium resulting in depolarization of the cell thus generating an electrical impulse.\n\n \u25cf Serotonin receptor type 4: is a G-protein coupled receptor that exhibits an excitatory element and when activated it causes up-regulation of adenylyl cyclase and over-expression of cAMP and more influx of calcium into the cell resulting in generation of an electrical impulse.\n\n \u25cf Serotonin receptor type 5: is a G-protein coupled receptor that exhibits an inhibitory element where its activation results in down-regulation of adenylyl cyclase and decrease levels of cAMP which in turn inhibits calcium influx, thus no electrical impulses are generated.\n\n \u25cf Serotonin receptors type 6 and 7: are G-protein coupled receptors that exhibits an excitatory element and when activated they cause up-regulation of adenylyl cyclase and over-expression of cAMP and more influx of calcium into the cell resulting in generation of an electrical impulse.\n\n - Glycine receptor: is a ligand-gated ion channel receptor that binds the neurotransmitter glycin which is the main inhibitory chemical of the CNS. When stimulated, it promotes calcium and sodium intracellular efflux and the influx of potassium causing hyperpolarization of the cell and inhibiting the generation of an electrical impulse.\n\n\"",

      "\"description_muscles_arm\" : \"\n This section will hold the discussion on muscles attached to the arm and they are grouped as muscles of the anterior compartment and the posterior compartment of the arm.\n\n - Muscles of the anterior compartment of the arm:\n \u25cf Biceps brachii: has two points of origin, with the short head originating from the tip of the scapular coracoid process and the long head originating from the supraglenoid of the scapula, they descend to form the bulk of the biceps muscle at the mid-humerus and terminate into the radial tuberosity. It functions in flexion and supination (palms of the hand facing upwards) of the forearm and receives innervation from the musculo-cutaneous nerve.\n\n \u25cf Coraco-brachialis: originates from the tip of the coracoid process medial to the short head of the biceps muscle and descends to terminate into the surface of the humerus just medial to the deltoid tuberosity. It functions in flexion of the arm and receives innervation from the musculo-cutaneous nerve.\n\n \u25cf Brachialis: originates from the anterior surface of the mid-humerus and descends to terminate into the ulnar tuberosity. It functions in flexion of the forearm and receives innervation from the musculo-cutaneous nerve and the radial nerve.\n\n - Muscle of the posterior compartment:\n \u25cf Triceps brachii: has three points of origin, with its long head originating from the infraglenoid tubercle of the scapula and the lateral head originating just above the radial groove at the posterior surface of the humerus and the medial head originates just below the intertubercular groove, they descends forming the bulk of the muscle at the mid-humerus and terminate into the olecranon process of the ulna. It functions in extension of the arm and forearm along with adduction of the arm and receives innervation from the radial nerve.\n\n\"",
      "\"description_breathing_regulation\" : \"\n The act of ventilation is regulated by a number of central centers and peripheral receptors where each plays a role in controlling the depth and frequency of breathing. The central centers located in the medulla and pons called the respiratory centers and assembled into groups and convey their action through changes in the breathing patter and depth as for the peripheral receptors they are a combination of chemo/mechanoreceptors that impact respiration by sensing changes in the peripheral parts of the body.\n\n - Groups of the respiratory center:\n \u25cf Ventral respiratory group: present on both sides of the medulla at its antero-lateral parts, it functions strictly in expiration however remain dormant during normal breathing. When activated during heavy breathing, the ventral group excites the abdominal muscles to bring upon a more thrustful contraction to maximize expulsion of air during expiration.\n\n \u25cf Dorsal respiratory group: present at the dorsal part medulla, it functions in setting the baseline of inspiration and is also impacted by the signals it receives from the peripheral chemo/mechanical receptors which in turn change the rhythm and patter of inspiration. Although the diaphragm is a voluntary skeletal muscle, it is being acted upon by the dorsal respiratory group where the latter sends its impulses at a steady pace to eventually have a burst of impulse and excitation upon the diaphragm that occurs at the start of inspiration then stops to allow the phase of expiration begin.\n\n \u25cf Penumotaxic center: present in the dorsal part of the pons (within the para-brachialis nucleus) it functions in dampening the effect of the dorsal group on the diaphragm and as a result it decreases the duration of inspiration, this effect of hypoventilation is seen in metabolic alkalosis.\n\n \u25cf Apenutic center: present at the lower aspects of the pons functions in stimulating and further exciting the dorsal group, it promotes extension of the inspiratory period by increasing the duration of excitation of the diaphragm (the longer diaphragmatic contraction; the longer the inspiration).\n\n - Central chemoreceptors: located in the pons and medulla to detect PH changes in the cerebro-spinal fluid. When blood levels of CO2 increase with the latter being blood-brain barrier permeable it enters the CSF in high levels where it is converted to H+ (hydrogen protons) and this increases the PH of the CSF. Once high PH is detected by chemoreceptors it stimulates hyperventilation to expel the excess arterial CO2 and blood vessels contract to redirect blood to the brain to wash out the hydrogen protons and CO2 from the CSF.\n\n - Peripheral chemoreceptors: located in the aortic arch and carotid sinus, these receptors are sensitive to changes in PH, CO2, and O2 levels. When O2 levels decrease below 60mm hg those chemoreceptors will stimulate hyperventilation and vasoconstriction in order to return O2 level back to normal. When CO2 levels increase and the PH decrease (detected by the carotid bodies) this puts the body in a state of acidosis which stimulates the increased firing in the central respiratory centers and start hyperventilation.\n\n - Mechanical receptors: located in the airways and lung parenchyma, it functions in the detection of over-stretching of the lung and airways during inspiration. Once over-stretching has occurred it halts the inspiratory phase and speeds the transition to the expiratory phase.\n\n\"",

The fibers of these muscles are seen to be running down obliquely in an anteroinferior fashion, however, these muscles only cover up the intercostal space up to the costochondral junction and the space from the costochondral junction to the sternum is occupied by the external intercostal membrane. It functions in elevating the ribs during inspiration and receives innervation from the intercostal nerves.\n\n \u25cf Internal intercostal muscles: it lies posterior to the external intercostal muscle and covers eleven intercostal spaces. It arises from the costal groove of the rib above and terminates into the superior margin of the rib below behind the point of termination of the external intercostal muscle. The fibers of this muscle are seen to be running obliquely in a posteroinferior fashion and like the external intercostal muscle it covers up the intercostal space up to the costochondral junction where the space from the costochondral junction to the sternum is occupied by the internal intercostal membrane. It functions in depressing the ribs during expiration and receives innervation from the intercostal nerves.\n\n \u25cf Innermost intercostal muscles: lies behind the internal intercostal muscle, it originates from the inferior rib above (particularly from the internal margin) to terminate into the superior margin of the rib below (particularly the interior margin) and its fibers are seen to be running obliquely in a posteroinferior fashion. It functions in depressing the ribs during expiration and receives innervation from the intercostal nerves.\n\n \u25cf Transversus thoracis muscles: locates in the internal thoracic wall, they originate from the lateral part of the dorsal surface of the sternum and xiphoid process running laterally and superiorly to terminate into the costal cartilages of ribs two to six. They function in depressing the ribs (2-6) during expiration and receive innervation from the second to sixth intercostal nerves.\n\n \u25cf Subcostal muscles: located in the inner thoracic wall, these muscles originate from the inner surface of one rib but terminate into inner surface of the first or second rib below, functions in depressing the ribs during expiration and receive innervation from the intercostal nerves.\n\n - Muscles that function primarily outside the thorax:\n \u25cf Pectoralis major: has two points of origin, the medial part of the clavical proximal to the manubrium sterni and from the lateral part of the ventral surface of the sternum and costal carilages of the first six ribe where it runs laterally to terminate into the lateral part of the intertubercular groove of the humerus. It functions in adduction, flexion and internal rotation of the arm, it receives innervation from the medial and lateral pectoral nerves (C5, C6, C7, C8, T1).\n\n \u25cf Pectoralis minor: originates from the anterior surface of the third to fifth ribs (close to costochondral junction) and ascends superolaterally to terminate into the medial border of the coracoid process of the sacpula. It functions in depressing the shoulder and elevating the ribs during inspiration, it receives innervation from the medial pectoral nerve (C8).\n\n \u25cf Subclavius muscle: originates from the superior surface of the first rib and costal cartilage and terminates into subclavian groove of the inferior surface of the clavicle, it functions in depressing the clavicle (thereby depressing the shoulder), it receives innervation from the subclavian nerve (C5 and C6).\n\n \u25cf Serratus anterior muscle: originates from the lateral surface of the first to ninth ribs and runs backward and medially to terminate into the costal surface (part facing the ribs) of the medial border of the scapula. It functions in moving the scapula laterally (protraction) thus anchoring elevation of the arm, elevating the ribs during inspiration, and rotating the scapula aiding in raising the arm above the head level. It receives innervation from the long thoracic nerve (C5, C6,C7).\n\n - The diaphragm: it originates from the dorsal surface of the xiphoid process, from the internal surfaces of costal margin and 7-12 ribs, bodies of 1-3 lumbar vertebrae, and medial and lateral arcuate ligaments to terminate into the central tendon of the diaphragm (but the upper surface of the diaphragm levels with the fifth intercostal space). The diaphragm is the main respiratory skeletal muscle which contracts upon inspiration and moves downward increasing the area of thoracic space , it also relaxes upon expiration and moves upward decreasing the area of thoracic space.\n\n The diaphragm forms the partition between the thoracic and abdominal cavity, when observed from the abdominal cavity it seems to look like a dome-shaped structure, thus its right and left parts are referred to as right and left domes of the diaphragm. The central part of the diaphragm consists of the central tendon, the structure on which the heart overlies. The diaphragm receives innervation from the phrenic nerve (C3, C4, C5).\n\n The diaphragm is pierced by the vena cave at the level of T8 verterba, by the esophagus at the level of T10 vertebra (including the vagus nerves), and by the esophagus at the level of T12 vertebra (including the azygos and hemiazygos nerves).\n\n - Right and left crura of the diaphragm: they both function in anchoring the diaphragm during contraction and form a clump like action on the esophagus thus contributing in the prevention of acid reflux. The right crus originates from the first to third lumbar vertebra and the left crus originates from the first and second lumbar verterba. The right and left crura curve around the abdominal aorta forming the aortic hiatus (through which the abdominal aorta pierces the diaphragm).\n\n\"",

When describing the thalamus, its anterior end forms the posterior boundary of the interventricular foramen and its posterior end is expanded forming the pulvinar (lies over the superior colliculus), its inferior surface is continuous with the midbrain's tegmentum and its medial surface forms the lateral wall of the third ventricle (both thalami are connected to one another at their medial surfaces by bands of gray matter called interthalamic connection fibers).\n\n The thalamus is divided by the internal medullary lamina ( vertical bands of white matter) into medial and lateral halves, however when the internal medullary lamina almost reaches the anterior part of the thalamus it splits forming a Y-shape thus further dividing the thalamus into an anterior part.\n\n - Subdivisions of the thalamus:\n \u25cf Median part of the thalamus: its functions are associated with the limbic system and they are involved in processing of recent memory and emotional tone. This part of the thalamus posses the anterior thalamic nuclei which receive afferent fibers from the mammillo-thalamic tract which originates from the mammillary nuclei, the cingulate gyrus and the hypothalamus, it also sends efferent fibers to the cingulate gyrus and the hypothalamus.\n\n \u25cf Medial part of the thalamus: it integrates sensory information (somatic, visceral, olfactory) and relates them to the person's emotion and subjective state. It posses the dorsomedial nucleus which receives afferent fibers from the prefrontal cortex, hypothalamus, and other thalamic nuclei as it also sends efferent fibers to the prefrontal cortex hypothalamus and the other thalamic nuclei.\n\n \u25cf Lateral part of the thalamus: is further subdivided into dorsal and ventral tiers.\n \u2023 Dorsal tier of the lateral part of the thalamus: it posses the lateral dorsal and lateral posterior nuclei and the pulvinar.

It is important to understand that the thalamus also provides sensory-motor connections with the cerebellum via the cerebellar-rubro-thalamic-cortical-ponto-cerebellar pathway and with basal ganglion via the corticalstriatal-pallidal-thalamic-cortical pathway and that both pathways are necessary for normal voluntary movement.\n\n - epithalamus: is of two parts, the habenular nucleus and the pineal gland.\n \u25cf Habenular nucleus: integrates olfactory, somatic, and visceral afferent information, it lies medial to the posterior surface of the thalamus and receives afferent fibers form the amygdaloid nucleus in the temporal lobe via the stria medullaris thalami. The afferent fibers can also pass from the hippocampal formation to the habenular nucleus through the fornix, a portion of the afferent fibers from the stria medullaris thalami cross the midline forming the habenular commissure and terminate in the contralateral habenular nucleus.

      "\"description_gastric_motility\" : \"\n The stomach function in storing, mixing, and grinding of edibles where its contractions that serve the mixing purpose turn the solid contents into a smaller set volumes of semi-fluid substance called chyme which is a mixture of the broken edibles and the gastric secretions. Motility of the stomach comprises of three phases, storage, mixing, and emptying of gastric contents into the duodenum.\n\n - Storage: when receiving content from the esophagus, the stomach relaxes and is more receptive of edibles, a phenomenon dubbed receptive relaxation. The relaxation and distention of the stomach is carried out via the vagus nerve through the vago-vagal reflex, once the distention of stomach walls is sensed by the vagus nerves it sends impulses to the brainstem that in turn generates efferent impulses carried via the vagus nerve to the gastric wall resulting in further distention and accommodates gastric filling (note that the stomach can expand as much as holding in four liters).\n\n - Mixing: the edibles received from the esophagus reside at the upper portion of the stomach, a peristatltic wave is generated from the mid-portion of the stomach (at a rate of approximately four waves per minute) going upwards toward the fundus and downwards toward the fundus, these contraction grind and mix the gastric contents to form the chyme. The circular rhythmic contractions increase in intensity which causes vigorous mixing propelling the contents of the upper part of the stomach downwards and the contents of the antrum against the pyloric sphincter but since the later is strongly contracted the chyme repels off and is back into the antrum for further mixing however due to the strong contractions at the pyloris region of the stomach some of the chyme is expelled through the pyloric sphincter (a phenomenon called the pyloric pump), once the gastric content sizes up to the 3-6mm range then it is able to pass through the pyloric sphincter.\n\n - Gastric emptying: is the final phase of gastric motility, as the name suggests its emptying of gastric contents into the duodenum once the chyme has reached an adequate volume. Naturally, the pylorus muscle has a constricted inlet and outlet as well as a diameter that only allows liquids to pass through owing to the thickness of the muscle. The process of gastric emptying is influenced by physical and hormonal factors (for hormonal factors, see GIT physiology - GIT hormones), the physical factors include the PH, osmolality, and volume of the chyme. If the duodenum senses high acidity as low as a PH value of 4, it sends impulses through the myenteric plexus to slow down gastric contractions and emptying so that hydrogen protons are being adequately and efficiently buffered by pancreatic bicarbonate. Isotonic gastric content are emptied through the stomach with ease unlike hypertonic content which slows down gastric emptying. An increase in the volume of gastric content increases the rate of gastric emptying due to the distention of the stomach wall that stimulates the myenteric plexus to generate inhibitory signals to the pyloric sphincter and increase the intensity of gastric contractions.\n\n\"",

      "\"description_adrenal_gland_hormones\" : \"\n The adrenal gland is a four layer gland where each layer is specialized in secreting certain chemicals that aid in bodily functions. Starting from the most superficial layer to the deep layer; first is the zona glomerulosa and it is concerned with secreting aldosterone (mineralocorticoid), the second layer is the zona fasciculata which secrete cortisol (corticosteroid), the third layer is the zona reticularis and is specialized in secreting androgens (see physiology of reproduction - androgen synthesis), the last layer that forms the core of the supra-renal gland is the medulla which secretes the catecholamines epinephrine and nore-epinephrine.\n\n - Synthesis of aldosterone: aldosterone is a steroid hormone meaning that it originates from its precursor cholesterol where the latter goes through biochemical enzymatic changes to finally give off the hormone cholesterol.\n\n - Stimulants of aldosterone secretion:\n \u25cf When low blood pressure/volume is sensed by the renal artery and arterioles of the kidney it stimulates the kidney to produce and release renin from the juxta-glomerular cells into the blood stream while in the blood stream renin binds to angiotensinogen (a plasma protein synthesized by the liver), the renin then cleaves angiotensinogen to angiotensin-1, the latter travels via the blood stream to the lungs where it is converted to angiotensin-2 by the angiotensin-converting enzyme, angiotensin-2 then travels to the supra-renal gland and binds to its extracellular G-protein coupled receptor which via the adenylyl cyclase pathway results in the phosphorylation and activation of the enzymes responsible for catalyzing the biochemical reactions of converting cholesterol to aldosterone and stimulating its secretion from the cell.\n\n \u25cf Electrolyte imbalances: when sodium levels drop below normal or potassium levels rise above normal (hyponatremia and hyperkalemia), these changes stimulate the biochemical enzymatic conversion of cholesterol to aldosterone to help regain the balance of disturbed electrolyte levels.\n\n \u25cf Adreno-cortico-tropic hormone: when the body experiences stress (i.e long term exhaustion or trauma), the hypothalamus releases corticotropin-releasing hormone which stimulates the anterior pituitary gland to synthesize and secrete adreno-cortico-tropic hormone. This hormone binds to the extracellular G-protein coupled receptor of the supra-renal gland and through the adenylyl cyclase pathway via protein kinase-A, it phosphorylates and activates the enzymes concerned with catalyzing the biochemical reactions that convert cholesterol to aldosterone.\n\n - Mechanism of action of aldosterone:\n \u25cf When aldosterone is secreted from the zona glomerularis of the supra-renal gland, it binds to plasma proteins but the majority of the steroidal hormone binds to transcortin (a plasma protein specialized in binding steroidal hormones of the supra-renal gland). Aldosterone exerts its function on the renal collecting duct cells where it travels freely across their membrane then resulting in the over-expression and up-regulation of sodium absorbing channels and potassium secreting channels thus more sodium is absorbed from the formed urine and more potassium is secreted. It should be noted that whenever sodium is absorbed or secreted water follows sodium and since there is a net absorption of sodium (and water) to the blood in the presence of aldosterone, blood volume increases thereby increasing blood pressure.\n\n - Synthesis of cortisol: being a steroidal hormone like aldosterone, corstisol is synthesized through a series of intracellular enzymatic biochemical reactions from its precursor cholesterol.\n\n - Stimulant of cortisol release: when the body experiences stress (be it long term exhaustion or trauma) the hypothalamus releases cortico-tropin releasing hormone which stimulates the anterior pituitary gland to release adreno-cortico-tropic hormone, the latter binds to the extracelular G-protein coupled receptor of the supra-renal gland and through the adenylyl cyclase patheway via protein kinase-A, it phosphorylates and activates the enzymes concerned with catalyzing the biochemical conversion of cholesterol to cortisol. Like aldosterone, cortisol binds to transcortin which is a plasma protein specialized in carrying the steroidal hormones of the supra-renal gland.\n\n - Mechanism of action of cortisol:\n \u25cf Liver: cortisol diffuses freely into the hepatocyte membrane. In the liver, cortisol breaks down the glycogen polymers into glucose monomers, it also activates the gluconeogenesis pathway which utilizes non-starch chemicals and converts them to glucose, those non-starch substances can be amino-acids, glycerol, and lactic acid.\n\n \u25cf Skeletal muscles: cortisol is responsible for the breaking down of proteins to amino acids in most protein reservoirs of the body via a process called protein catabolism, mainly the skeletal muscles since they hold a major fraction of proteins and the amino-acids are transported to the liver to aid in the formation of glucose via the gluconeogenesis pathway.\n\n \u25cf Adipose tissue: cortisol stimulates and up-regulates the enzyme hormone sensitive lipase when it enters the adipocytes, this enzyme breaks down the triglycerides of the adipocytes into glycerol and fatty acids where the glycerol is transported to the liver to aid in the process of gluconeogenesis and the fatty acids are distributed to other parts of the body.\n\n \u25cf Blood vessels: cortisol results in the up-regulation of the alpha-adrenergic receptors thus increasing the affinity of epinephrine and other vaso-constrictors causing the tunica media of the vessels to contract (i.e vaso-constriction) and increase blood pressure.\n\n \u25cf Immunity: cortisol down-regulates the immune system by decreasing the production of white blood cells and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines thereby suppressing existing inflammation but it also increases the risk of infections due it rendering the immune system inactive.\n\n - Synthesis of catecholamines: when the body experiences an acute bout of stress the sympathetic nervous system activates the fight or flight response, the lateral horn of the gray matter of the spinal cord segments T1-L3 contain pre-ganglionic neurons concerned with the activity of the sympathetic nervous system (S2-S4 are concerned with parasympathetic activity). When activated, these neurons send out signals via the anterior ramus of the spinal cord and to the supra-renal medulla, here, the terminal axon of the anterior ramus secretes acetylcholine that binds to the nicotinic receptors of the chromoffin cells and once stimulated, the nicotinic receptors result in depolarization of the cell which in turn opens the voltage gated calcium channels thereby establishing calcium influx. The calcium binds to the synaptophysin protein of the epinephrine/norepinephrine vesicles and to the synaptophysin protein of the cell membrane forming a link between both entities then epinephrine/norepinephrine are released from the cell via exocytosis from the chromaffin cell's terminal axon. It should be noted that epinephrine/norepinephrine are pre-synthesized and stored in their designated vesicles in the terminal axons.\n\n \u2713 Epinephrine and norepinephrine are synthesized through a series of biochemical enzymatic changes in the chromaffin cells; first tyrosin is converted to L-DOPA by tyrosine hydroxylase, L-DOPA is converted to dopamin by dopamin decarboxylase, dopamin is converted to norepinephrine by beta-hydroxylase, and lastly, norepinephrine is converted to epinephrine by PNMT.\n\n - Mechanism of action of catecholamines:\n \u25cf Cardiovascular: it increases heart rate by binding to the adrenergic receptors of the SA and AV node thus increasing cardiac action potential and SA/AV node firing. It also acts on the adrenergic receptors of the ventricular myocardium resulting in increased contractility and stroke volume. They also exert their actions on the blood vessels by binding to the adrenergic receptors of the latter and causing the tunica media to contract as this contraction results in vasoconstriction and increase in blood pressure.\n\n \u25cf Respiration: catecholamines bind to the beta2-adrenergic receptors and through the adenyly cyclase pathway they result in dilation of tracheal smooth muscles which results in dilation of the airway and allowing entry of more air.\n\n \u25cf Liver: catecholamines bind to the extracellular G-protein coupled receptors of hepatocytes and vthrough the adenylyl cyc;ase pathway, they stimulate the break down of glycogen to glucose via glycogenolysis, they also stimulate the gluconeogenesis pathway which is synthesizing glucose from non-starch chemicals such as glycerol, amino-acids, and lactic acids.\n\n \u25cf Fat: catecholamines phosphorylate and activate the enzyme hormone sensitive lipase in the adipocytes which breaks down triglycerides to glycerol and fatty acids where the glycerol is utilized by the liver for gluconeogenesis and the fatty acids the distributed other parts of the body.\n\n\"",

      "\"description_signal_transduction_physiology\" : \"\n Upon activation by a certain stimuli and inorder to generate an action potential that propagates along the axons, a receptor must reach its own threshold. The resting membrane potential of receptors has been described as 70 milli-volts and inorder to generate an action potential the receptor's membrane potential increases to a 50 milli-volts.\n\n Once an action potential is generated, ions within the neurone change as voltage gated sodium channels open allowing the influx of sodium and potassium channels open allowing efflux of potassium thus causing depolarization along the length of the neuron.\n\n - After depolarization, the neuron passes through three periods of activation:\n \u25cf Absolute refractory period: occurs after depolarization when the sodium channels has been closed and since they are closed no action potential can be generated no matter how strong the impulse since all sodium channels are closed.\n\n \u25cf Effective refractory period: in this phases some of the sodium channels open while others remain closed. Here, a very strong impulse could generate an action potential but since half the sodium channels are closed there won't be an effective conduction and the impulse will not propagate.\n\n \u25cf Relative refractory period: now the membrane has repolarized and the sodium channels have opened but it has not yet reached its resting potential (still at a high threshold), an action potential can be generated but it has to be above the ordinary impulse for conduction and propagation.\n\n \u2713 Nerve fibers are classified according to their size and myelination where size and myelination are directly proportionate to speed conductivity.\n\n - Type A nerve fibers:\n \u25cf Alpha subtype: are myelinated nerve fibers with the largest diameter and fastest conductivity, functions in supplying skeletal muscles (extrafusal fibers).\n\n \u25cf Beta subtype: are myelinated nerve fibers with a medium sized diameter and medium conductivity towards electrical impulse, functions in the transmission of touch and pressure.\n\n \u25cf Gamma subtype: are myelinated nerve fibers with medium size and conductivity, functions in supplying skeletal muscles (intrafusal fibers).\n\n \u25cf Delta subtype: are small myelinated nerve fibers with medium conductivity, functions in relying temperature, pain, pressure, and touch.\n\n - Type B nerve fibers: are small myelinated nerve fibers that posses medium speed in conductivity, functions as pre-ganglionic autonomic nerve fibers and afferent fibers of the visceral organs.\n\n - Type C nerve fibers: are non-myelinated nerve fibers with the smallest diameter and weakest conductivity, functions as post-ganglionic autonomic fibers and rely visceral pain (slow pain).\n\n - Types of sensory nerve fibers:\n \u25cf Type 1a: are largest myelinated nerve fibers with the highest conductivity, functions as muscle spindle afferent fibers relying information of the extent of muscle stretch.\n\n \u25cf Type 1b: shows the same properties as type 1a but functions as golgi tendon organ afferent fibers relying information about the tension being applied to a muscle tendon.\n\n - type 2: are myelinated nerve fibers with medium size and conductivity, functions in relying touch and pressure.\n\n \u25cf Type 3: are myelinated nerve fibers that exhibit a smaller size but medium conductivity, functions in relying pain, temperature, and touch.\n\n - Type 4: are non myelinated nerve fibers with the smallest side and weakest conductivity, functions in relying temperature and visceral pain.\n\n - When an impulse reaches the end of an axon it needs to rely the impulse to the following neuron, and this is done by either divergence of convergence. divergence occurs most commonly in neuronal pools where an axon/neuron rely its impulses to more than one or a number of neurons, convergence occurs when a single neuron receives impulses from a number of neurons.\n\n - There are two ways in which the intensity of an impulse could be increase, spatial and temporal summation. Spatial summation is when the number of nerve fibers involved in conducting the impulse increase to further increase the latter intensity, temporal summation is increasing the intensity of the impulse by increasing its frequency in the nerve fibers.\n\n\"",
      "\"description_cardiac_electrical_conduct\" : \"\n The heart is a muscle that requires no neurotransmitter to maintain its contraction but a neurotransmitter can affect the speed, force of contraction, and the velocity in which cardiac impulses are carried throughout the heart.\n\n - Cardiac impulse conduction: the SA node located at the top left of the right atrium sets the pace of the heart and is affected by neural stimuli from the sympathetic and parasympathetic fibers. Electrical impulse from the SA node ( second fastest conduction) travel via internodal fibers to the AV node (slowest conduction) located at the floor of the atrium and just superior to the interventricular septum. The AV node is connected to a dense nerve fiber called the bundle of HIS located within the upper portion interventricualr septum, Bundle of HIS then divides into right and left bundle branches. Once the bundle branches reach the ventricles they give off numerous nerve fibers called the purkinje fibers (fastest conduction) that are distributed through out the myocardium of the ventricles.\n\n - Impulse generation in the Sino-Atrial node: the SA node is constantly generating electrical impulses (without a neurotransmitter) at 60-100 impulses per minute thus setting the normal rate of the heart (dubbed the pacemaker of the heart). Impulse generation in the SA node has the latter going into three phases listed as phase 4, 0, and 3, these three phases are explained next.\n\n - Phases of electrical impulse generation in the SA node:\n \u25cf Phase 4:\n \u2022 This phase is a depolarizing phase that prompts the phase 0 which is the rapid surge in depolarization. In phase four the SA node lies at the -60 mV membrane potential (recovering from hyperpolarization), a subtype of sodium channels called the funny sodium channels open allowing sodium influx (in response potassium channels open resulting in potassium efflux).\n\n \u2022 As sodium moves in the cell is further depolarized causing the opening of a subtype of calcium channels called the T-type calcium channels, this results in calcium influx (however the cell is not yet to completely depolarize unless L-type calcium channels open).\n\n \u2022 T-type calcium channel influx causes the membrane potential to further depolarize at -40 mV, this membrane potential causes the opening of L-type calcium channels resulting in the sudden spike of calcium influx and further depolarization to the -30 mV membrane potential and phase 0 ensue.\n\n \u25cf Phase 0: this phase reflects the sudden and rapid surge in depolarization due to the influx of calcium from the L-type calcium channels. However in this phase, the funny sodium channels and the T-type calcium channels close thus the sodium and T-type calcium levels gradually decline but the L-calcium levels increase.\n\n \u25cf Phase 3: this phase reflects hyperpolarization where potassium channels open and potassium moves outward while the sodium channels close and sodium influx decreases inorder to hyperpolarize the cell, the L-type calcium channels close and the L-type calcium rapidly declines.\n\n \u2713 Note that the impulses generated in the SA are continuous and after phase 3 comes phase 4.\n\n - Impulse conduction in the cardiac muscles: the myocardium is depolarized by the depolarizing act of the SA node and the impulse generation occurs in four steps; phase 0, phase 1, phase 2, phase 3, phase 4.\n\n \u25cf Phase 0: this stage reflects the sudden and rapid surge of depolarization that occurs in the myocardium where the voltage gated sodium channels open causing a rapid influx of sodium which is so rapid and strong that the membrane is depolarized to +30mv. Moreover, the sudden spike in depolarization occurs much faster than that of the SA node and this phase is followed by phase 1.\n\n \u25cf Phase 1: this stage reflects the simple repolarization myocardial cells go through the following the rapid and strong surge of depolarization. The sodium channels in this stage close resulting in the cessation of sodium influx and decrease in sodium levels, also a number of but not all potassium channels open causing an efflux of potassium.\n\n \u25cf Phase 2: this phase reflects a stable stage of depolarization where the potassium channels are open for potassium efflux but also the L-type calcium channels open causing a steady influx of calcium (hence, this stage is stable as there is a steady influx of calcium) with no sodium channels acting across the myocardium.\n\n \u25cf Phase 3: this phase reflects complete repolarization of the myocardium which is established by increasing the potassium efflux and decreasing the calcium influx through inhibition of the L-type calcium channels.\n\n \u25cf Phase 4: reflects the stage of resting potential meaning that the membrane has repolarized. In this phase, low levels of sodium and calcium move into the cells and large amounts of potassium move out, this establishes balance across the membrane where there is no net inward or outward currents being generated thus the membrane lies at rest.\n\n - Impulse conduction in the AV node: the AV node has its own firing rate that ranges from 40-60 beats per minute, not only it serves as a conduit carrying the impulse from the SA node but it also slightly delays the impulse coming from the SA node allowing the atria to completely contract.\n\n \u2713 Unlike skeletal muscles, the heart muscles cannot be tetanized meaning that they must complete a full impulse conduction cycle to generate a second impulse and this is termed as excitability which can be explained through the concept of refractory periods that is detailed in CNS physiology - signal transduction section (periods of neuron activation).\n\n\"",

The stronger the force and volume of blood flow in the capillaries means more blood will be filtered.\n\n - Capillary oncotic pressure: is a force opposing filtration and is generated by the plasma proteins present in the blood specifically albumin as the plasma proteins act as an absorbent of fluid and retains plasma products intravascularly thereby counteracting the process of filtration.\n\n - Glomerular capsule hydrostatic pressure: as the glomerular capsule fills with the ultra-filtrate it starts to develop its own hydrostatic pressure which in turn pushes back against the hydrostatic pressure of the capillaries thus acting as a force that opposes filtration.\n\n - Filtering through the glomerulus:\n \u25cf Capillary endothelium: this structure exhibits wide fenestrations that permit the passing of almost all substances except blood cells.\n\n \u25cf Glomerular basement membrane: this membrane is a negatively charged membrane owing to its proteoglycans nature that is essentially glycosaminoglycans which are by themselves negatively charged.

The motor nerves are the ansa cervicalis which is formed by the anterior branches of C1-C3 (supplies omohyoid, thyrohyoid, sternohyoid, and sternothyroid muscles), the phrenic nerve which is formed by the anterior branches of the cervical nerves C3, C4, and C5 (supplies the diaphragm), and the anterior branches of C1-C4 that supply the anterior and middle scalene muscles. The sensory nerves are the transverse cervical nerve which is formed by the anterior branches of C1 and C2 (supplies the anterior part of the neck's skin, the supraclavicular nerve which is formed by the anterior branches of C3 and C4 (supplies the skin above, below and on the clavicle), the greater auricular nerve which arises from the anterior branches of C2 and C3 (supplies the auricle and external canal of the ear), the lesser occipital nerve which arises from the anterior branch of C2 (supplies the skin over the mastoid process and the posterolateral part of the head).\n\n - Posterior nerves of the neck: the nerves here emerge from the spine through the intervertebral foramen and since the motor innervation have been explained along with the posterior muscles of the neck, only the sensory skin supply will be mentioned. The posterior skin of the neck receives its sensory innervation from the dorsal branches of the nerves C3-C6 where C3 innervates the top of the neck and C6 innervates the bottom of the neck.\n\n\"",

      "\"description_small_bowel_motility\" : \"\n The small intestine functions in digesting, mixing, absorbing, and propelling chyme. The digestion is carried out by enzymes and small intestinal secretions, the mixing is carried out by the circular segmented contractions, the absorption is carried out viz the intestinal villi, and the propulsion occurs via peristaltic waves. The motility of the small intestine can be categorized into two types of contractions those are the segmented and peristaltic contractions.\n\n - Segmented contractions: these types of contractions are concerned with the mixing of chyme with intestinal secretions and enzymes, it is established by the myenteric plexus sending out stimulatory impulses causing parts of the intestine containing the chyme to constrict (the circular muscles; decrease in diameter) this splits the portion of chyme into haves then the constricted part dilates back bringing the two portions of chyme together, this way the chyme and intestinal secretions form a mix and with the chyme being spread all around the intestinal mucosa to be absorbed by the villi, these waves are generated at a rate of 10 waves per minute and are characterized as short duration contractions.\n\n - Peristaltic waves: they are concerned with progression of chyme through the intestines to the colon and are generated at irregular intervals as these waves are generally slow in character. The peristaltic wave is carried out by the myenteric plexus sending stimulatory impulses to the circular muscles behind the chyme causing constriction and inhibitory impulses to the muscles anterior to the chyme causing dilation, this technique results in propulsion of the chyme further into the intestine and towards the colon.\n\n \u2713 Both types of contractions are generated by the dilation of the intestine, once the mechanoreceptors sense the dilation and filling of the intestine they stimulates the myenteric plexus to carry out the impulses for these contractions.\n\n\"",

      "\"description_ears\" : \"\n The ear is divided into three parts; the external ear, the middle ear, and the internal.\n\n - External ear: consists of the auricle and the external acoustic meatus.\n \u25cf The auricle: is the cartilaginous part of the ear and consists of the helix (outermost curved part of the ear), anti-helix (the inner curved part of the ear), the targus (seen projecting from the face and anterior to the external acoustic meatus), anti-targus(cartilaginous projection lateral to the acoustic meatus and just above the lobule), the concha (is the depression seen lateral to the acoustic meatus) and the lobule (the fleshy dangling part of the ear).\n\n \u25cf The external acoustic mueatus: is the outer opening of the ear canal and ends at the tympanic membrane (eardrum) on the inside, the first part of the ear canal consists of cartilage and the inner part consists of bones as it enters the petrous part of the temporal bone.\n\n - Innervation of the external ear:\n \u25cf The anterior wall of the ear canal is innervated by the vagus nerve and the posterior wall is innervated by the auriculotemporal nerve (a branch of the mandibular nerve)\n \u25cf The external ear is mostly supplied by the facial nerve but the ear canal.\n \u25cf The skin surrounding the external acoustic meatus is supplied by the vagus nerve.\n \u25cf The targus and the adjacent helix are supplied by the auriculotemporal nerve (branch of the mandibular nerve).\n\n - Middle ear: consists primarily of three bones connected to one another.\n \u2022 The malleus which connected to the tympanic membrane at one end and to the incus at the other end and is recognized as the largest of the three bones.\n \u2022 The incus which connected to the malleus at one end and to the stapes at the other end.\n \u2022 The stapes which is connected to the incus at one end and to the oval window of the middle ear which opens into the internal ear.\n\n \u2713 these bones vibrate as sound waves hit the tympanic membrane.\n\n - The phrayngotympanic tube: extends from the middle ear into the nasopharynx inorder to adjust pressure on the middle ear with the nose (equal to atmospheric pressure), it proximal part is bony but distally it is cartilaginous.\n\n The bones of the middle ear are occupied in a space that is identified as two separate cavities, the epitympanic cavity and the tympanic cavity.\n The epitympanic cavity extends above the level of the tympanic membrane where the upper half of the malleus and incus ascend through. The tympanic membrane occupies most of the middle ear where the lower half of both the malleus and incus and the stapes bone lie, it also receives the opening of the pharyngotympanic tube.\n\n - Walls of the middle ear:\n \u25cf The roof: is the roof of the epitympanic cavity, also referenced to as the tegmental wall, it is made out of a thin bony sheet of the petrous part of the temporal bone called the tegmentum tympani, just above this bony sheet lies the middle cranial fossa.\n \u25cf The floor: is formed by a bony sheet (part of the tympanic bone of the temporal bone) that is being crossed inferiorly by the internal jagular vein, so it is fair to say that the floor of the middle ear separates the latter from the internal jugular vein, the floor is also called the jugular wall solely for this purpose. At the midline it also shows the opening for the tympanic nerve (originates from the glossopharyngeal nerve).\n\n \u25cf The medial wall: is the part where the stapes bone is connects, this wall has numerous features.\n \u2022 The oval window is an opening to which the stapes bone is connected to, it allows vibration of the upper half of the choclea.\n \u2022 The round window is an opening which allows vibration of the lower half of the choclea, the promontory which is a bulge seen between the oval and round window lying in the midline of the medial wall formed by the first cochlear spiral in the internal ear.\n \u2022 The prominence of the facial canal which is a bony prominence seen above the oval window and is produced by the passing of the facial nerve\n \u2022 Above the prominence of the facial nerve is the prominence of the lateral semicircular canal formed by the impression of the lateral semicircular canal (an internal ear organ) lying posterior to the wall.\n\n \u25cf The lateral wall: is made out of the tympanic membrane which is the borderline structure separating the middle ear from the external ear.\n\n \u25cf The anterior wall: shows the opening of the tensor tympani muscle, the pharyngotympanic tube, the lesser petrosal nerve and corda tympani nerve (structures are mentioned from top to bottom). This wall separates the tympanic cavity of middle ear from the internal carotid artery.\n\n \u25cf The posterior wall: the upper part of the wall shows the aditus to the mastoid antrum which is an opening (irregularly shaped) that moves air from middle ear to mastoid cells in mastoid antrum to regulate pressure in the middle ear and at its lower part it shows the opening for the chorda tympani nerve.\n\n - The internal ear: the internal ear is a more complex structure, it consists of the cochlea and the three semicircular canals, collectively called the bony labyrinth. The bony labyrinth holds within its internal space a duct system and two sacs, collectively known as the membranous labyrinth.\n\n - Bony labyrinth:\n - cochlea: a bony looping structure that twirls around it self for three loops and then continue upwards forming a cavitary bone called the vestibule that runs diagonally upwards to eventually form the three bony semicircular canals, the posterior, the anterior, and the lateral semicircular canal.\n\n - Membranous labyrinth: the cavity within the cochlea is divided into two spaces and a structure passing in between these two spaces, the scala vestibuli which contains the fluid perilymph, the cohclear duct which contains the fluid endolymph and the scala tympani which contains the fluid perilymph.\n As the scala vestibuli begins from the start of the cochlea, it also continues to form the cavity of the vestibule and the space in between the ducts of the semicircular canal ands the bones of the canals (contains the fluid perilymph).\n The cochlear duct continues from the cochlea to the vestibule where it then forms the saccule (a sac functioning in body balance), from the saccule a utrocsaccular dusct arises and divides into two branches, a branch that continues to form the endplymphatic duct which terminates into the endolymphatic sac (reabsorbs endolymph and modulates its quantity) and a branch that form the utricle sac (functions in body balance) which then gives rise to the three semicircular ducts.\n The scala tympani begins in the cochlea and only continues to the round window of the middle ear (contains perilymph). At the end of the scala tympani and just below the round window it shows a small opening called the cochlear canaliculus which opens into the cochlear aqueduct, a duct that communicates with the subarachnoid space of the posterior cranial fossa.\n\n - Innervation of the middle ear:\n \u25cf The typmpanic nerve: which is a branch of the glossopharyngeal nerve and it innervates the mucousa of the middle ear and phraryngotympanic tube.\n \u25cf The vagus and auriculotemporal nerves innervate the part of the tympanic membrane facing the middle ear.\n\n - Innervation of the internal ear:\n \u25cf Vestibulocochlear nerve: leaves through the internal acoustic meatus to the internal ear and upon its exit, it divides into a chochlear nerve and a vetibular nerve.\n\n \u2022 The cochlear nerve: goes to the cochlea where it receives and conveys electrical impulses to the medial geniculate body (eventually to the auditory cortex for sound interpretation).\n\n \u2022 Vestibular nerve: divides into superior and inferior branches, the superior branch receives and conveys electrical impulses from the anterior and lateral semi-circular ducts and the utricle, the inferior branch receives and conveys electrical impulses from the posterior semi-circular canal and the saccule. Impulses received by the vestibular nerve are conveyed to the cerebellum for balance interpretation.\n\n blood supply of the ear:\n \u25cf External ear: receives blood from the branches of the external carotid artery, posterior auricular branch which begins from the lobule and passes to the posterior part of the auricle to supply the posterior auricular surface (hence the name), the anterior auricular artery which further divides into an inferior artery which supply the auricle inferiorly (with the lobule), medial artery supply which begins at the targus and supplies the medial part of the auricle, the superior artery which begins at the start of the auricle's helix above the targus and supplies the superior part of the auricle.\n\n \u25cf Blood supply of middle ear: the middle ear receives numerous blood vessels to supply its mucosa, the anterior tympanic artery that originates from the maxillary artery (a branch of the external carotid artery) supplies the internal part of the tympanic membrane, the stylomastoid artery (a branch of the posterior auricular artery) supplies the internal part of the tympanic membrane, the caroticotympanic artery which originates from the internal carotid artery and supplies the mucous membrane of the tympanic cavity, a petrosal branch of the middle meningeal artery (called petrosal for its relation with the petrous part of the temporal bone) supplies the part of the facial nerve passing through the middle ear.\n\n - Muscles of the middle ear:\n \u25cf Tensor tympani muscle: it originates from the proximal cartilagenous part of the pharyngotympanic tube and terminates into the handle of malleus, it is innervated by the medial pterygoid nerve of the mandibular nerve, it pulls the malleus bone medially tensing the tympanic membrane, the tension imposed on the tympanic membrane decreases the amplitude of the loud noises thus protecting the ears from loud noise irritation.\n\n \u25cf Stapedius muscle: originates from the pyramidal eminence on theposterior wall of the middle ear and terminates into the neck of the stapedius bone, it is innervated by the nerve of stabedius which is a branch of the facial nerve, it further lowers sound waves before entering the inner ear.\n\n\"",

      "\"description_cardiac_contraction\" : \"\n Cardiac muscle contraction occurs via the contractile units of the muscle fibers called the sarcomere. One sacromere unit consists of two vertical Z-lines lying in parallel with one another, multiple thin fibers called actin, between every actin lies a thick fiber called myosin, and in the middle of the sarcomere unit lies the M-line which signifies the median part of the sarcomere.\n\n The two vertical Z-lines are located at a distance away from each other but the fibers arising from reach out to one another, the thin actin fibers are anchored to the Z-line by a structure called the Cap-Z and run horizontally towards the M-line but don't reach it, the thick myosin fibers arise from the Z-line via a string-like structure called titine, the fibers thicken and run horizontally towards the M-line and connect to the thick fibers of the opposite Z-line via their myosin tail.\n\n The area at which the actin fibers do not overlap the myosin fibers (the beginning of their origination) is called the I-band, the area where the actin and myosin fibers overlap is called the A-band, and the distance between the thin fibers in the median area of the sacromere is called the H-zone.\n\n \u2713 The cell membrane of the cardiac muscles (also called the sarcolema) contains deep trench-like structures called T-tubules which store large amounts of calcium (outside the cell), when action potential travels along the cell membrane and into the T-tubules it stimulates the opening of the calcium channels causing a calcium influx into the cell membrane. Moreover, within the cell membrane lies the sarcoplasmic reticulum which also contains calcium and as calcium moves into the cell from the T-tubules, it also stimulates the sarcoplasmic reticulum to release its own calcium into the cell and to further enhance contraction.\n\n - Troponins and tropomyosin:\n \u25cf Troponin-I: functions in inhibiting the binding sites on actin fibers preventing cross bridging between actin and myosin thereby inhibiting contraction.\n\n \u25cf Troponin-C: functions in binding calcium and moving troponin-I from the actin binding site to initiate contraction.\n\n \u25cf Troponin-T: functions in anchoring tropomyosin on to actin providing more stability for tropomyosin on actin.\n\n \u25cf Tropomyosin: is a thin filament that covers the myosin binding sites on actin to prevent cross bridging and contraction. It is aided into its position by troponin-T and troponin-I but is moved from its position by binding of calcium on to troponin-C.\n\n - Actin-myosin interaction:\n 1: Calcium binds to troponin-C and displaces the troponin I, T, and tropomyosin from the myosin binding sites on actin.\n\n 2: Now that the binding sites on actin are free, myosin still can't bind since it has an ADP and a Pi (phosphate) molecule attached to it.\n\n 3: The myosin has to free the phosphate molecule since the latter acts as a stabilizer and preventing movement of the myosin.\n\n 4: Myosin releases the Pi molecule and attaches to its binding site on actin, it uses the power generated by the ADP to propel the actin forward (this is the contraction).\n\n 5: After using the ADP, now myosin has no energy molecules and so ATP binds to and releases myosin from the its binding site on the actin fiber.\n\n 6: The enzyme myosin-ATPase converts the ATP attached to myosin into an ADP molecule and Pi molecule thus stabilizing the myosin.\n\n 7: Now that the first actin has been propelled forward, myosin releases its Pi and binds to the second actin.\n\n\"",
      "\"description_patho_post_pit\" : \"\n - Syndrome of inappropriate ADH release: is a condition characterized by the increased levels of anti-diuretic hormone due to a tumor of the posterior pituitary or an extra-pituitary tumor associated with the para-neoplastic secretion of ADH such as small cell lung cancer. High levels of ADH result in water retention and fluid excretion resulting in hypervolemia with characteristic hyponatermia and sodium concentrated urine. It presents with the signs and symptoms of hyponatermia (see renal pathology - electrolyte imbalances) and diagnosed with blood ADH levels, sodium levels in urine and blood, urine analysis, chest X-ray, and MRI. Management of this condition includes treatment directed towards the underlying cause, tolvaptan, fluid restriction, and slow administration of sodium (rapid rise of sodium results in osmotic demyelination syndrome; pontine myelinolysis).\n\n - Diabetes insipidus: is a condition characterized by two subtypes central and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. The central subtype is defined as decreased secretion of anti-diuretic hormone due to a tumor or trauma while the nephrogenic subtype is defined as unresponsive renal tubules to the ADH (is often increased in this subtype) due to genetic aquaporin-2 receptor defects or renal insult (infection or kidney injury). It presents with increased thirst and urination accompanied by increased voiding of dilute urine. This condition is diagnosed by urine analysis, blood and urine sodium levels, water deprivation test (central and nephrogenic; dilute urine), desmopressin administration (central; forms concentrated urine). Management of this condition includes desmopressin for central diabetes insipidus and hydrochlorothiazide for nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.\n\n\"",
      "\"description_function_cerebellum\" : \"\n The cerebellum functions mainly in coordination and balance of posture as these functions are elicited via nuclei (masses of gray matter), afferent, and efferent fibers. However, the cerebellum also has its functional areas that are concerned with coordinating gross movements. The cerebellum receives input from the cerebrum via the cerebro-cerebellar pathways inorder to execute its function.\n\n - Functionality of the cerebellar lobes:\n \u25cf Flocculo-nodular lobe: functions in coordinating and balancing the trunk when steady and moving along with coordination of eye movements.\n\n \u25cf Vermis: functions in maintaining a balanced proprioception of the axial skeleton and proximal limbs, it also coordinates the planned movement of the peripheral limbs when not exposed to a stimulus.\n\n \u25cf Lateral part of the cerebellum: functions in coordinating movements that are made in response to a stimulus.\n\n \u2713 The cerebellum receives information from the cerebral cortex via afferent fibers, processes the information received, then brings about the action required through its efferent fibers. In this section we will be listing the afferent and efferent pathways and describe their functions since the anatomy has already been explained in the anatomy of the cerebellum section.\n\n - Cerebellar afferent fibers:\n \u25cf Cotrico-ponto-cerebellar tract: carries sensory, motor, visual, and cognitive information to the pontine nuclei which gives rise to the transverse fibers of the pons that cross the midline to the opposite side and enter the cerebellar hemisphere through the middle cerebellar peduncle ending up as mossy fibers in the cerebellum, they function in coordinating planned motor movements, along with speech and eye movement.\n\n \u25cf Cerebro-olivary-cerebellar tract: carries sensory, motor, speech and visual information of the cerebral cortex, to the inferior olivary nuclei which gives rise to fibers that cross the midline to the opposite side and enter the cerebellar hemisphere through the inferior cerebellar peduncle ending up as climbing fibers in the cerebellum, it functions in learning and coordinating motor movements along with coordination of speech.\n\n \u25cf Cerebro-reticulo-cerebellar tract: arise from many different areas of the cerebral cortex and terminate in the reticular formation of the pons and meduula at both sides. The reticular formation gives rise to the reticulo-cerebellar fibers that enter the cerebellar hemisphere through the middle and inferior cerebellar peduncles, functions in coordinating conscious voluntary motor activity.\n\n \u25cf Anterior spino-cerebellar tract and posterior spino-cerebellar tract: see CNS physiology - ascending and descending spinal tracts.\n\n \u25cf Cuneo-cerebellar tract: originates from nucleus cuneatus in the medulla oblongata (do not cross) and enter the cerebellum through the inferior cerebellar peduncle and terminating as mossy fibers in the cerebellum. Refer to the section of ascending and descending spinal tracts in CNS physiology.\n\n \u25cf Vestibulo-cerebellar tract: originates from the vestibular nerve which receives information about motion and position from the inner ear. The vestibular nerve sends fibers (do not cross) that enter the cerebellum through the inferior cerebellar peduncle and some of the vestibular fibers pass to the vestibular nuclei in the brainstem where they synapse, then enter the cerebellum through the inferior cerebellar peduncle of the same side. These fibers terminate as mossy fibers in the cerebellum, functions in maintaining postural balance of the entire body.\n\n - Cerebellar efferent fibers (all efferent fibers coming out of the cerebellum are purkinje fibers):\n \u25cf Globuse-emboliform-rubral tract: originates from the globose and emboliform nuclei which receives information projecting from the intermediate regions of the cerebellar cortex, first the fibers pass through the superior cerebellar peduncle to the out side of the cerebellum where they cross the midline at the deccusation of the superior cerebellar peduncles and synape on the contralateral red nucleus, the red nucleus then gives rise to the rubrospinal tract which again crosses the midline to its original side. It functions in coordinating movement of the limbs especially the flexor muscles of the upper and lower limbs.\n\n \u25cf Dentothalamic tract: originates from the dentate nucleus (output of the lateral part of the cerebellar hemispheres) whose fibers exit the cerebellum through the superior cerebellar peduncle crossing the midline at the decussation of the superior cerebellar peduncle and synapsing in the ventrolateral nucleus of the thalamus, from there the fibers ascend through the internal capsule and corona radiata to terminate in the primary motor area of the cerebral cortex and descend from the cerebral cortex via the corticospinal tract, remember that the corticospinal tract crosses to the opposite side at the decussation of pyramids (meaning the dentatothalamic tract first crosses to the opposite side then crosses back to its original side again), the anterior portion of the dentate nucleus functons in cognition, rationality, and interpretation of objects with the space (visuospatial function; ability to relate a certain object to the environment) while the posterior portion functions in motor coordination.\n\n \u25cf Fastigial vestibular tract: originates from the fastigial nucleus with its fibers leaving the cerebellum through the inferior cerebellar peduncle to synapse in the lateral vestibular nucleus on both sides of the body. The lateral vestibular nucleus gives rise to the vestibulospinal tract that eventually terminate in the ipsilateral motor neurons of the spinal cord. Functions in maintaining postural balance and trunk balance in gait (walking).\n\n \u25cf Fastigial reticular tract: originates from the fastigial nucleus (receives information projecting from the vermis of the cerebellum), leaves the cerebellum through the inferior cerebellar peduncle and synapse with the neurons in the reticular formation (do not cross), from the reticular formation the fibers descend to influence the motor neurons of the spinal cord via the reticulospinal tract. Functions in inhibiting the flexor muscles and enabling the extensor muscles of the limbs. The cerebellum exerts its action on the cerebral cortex and the brainstem and not on the lower motor neurons (action is conveyed to the lower motor neurons via the descending tracts of the spinal cord).\n\n - Cerebellar nuclei:\n \u25cf Dentate nucleus: the anterior portion of the dentate nucleus functions in cognition, rationality, and interpretation of objects in relation to space (visuospatial function), as for the posterior portion of the dentate nucleus it functions in coordination of motor movements of both the limbs and axial skeleton.\n\n \u25cf Globose and emboliform nuclei: they both function in coordinating the movement of upper and lower limbs with more control being executed on the flexor compartments.\n\n \u25cf Fastigial nucleus: functions in maintaining postural balance and trunk balance with regards to a person's gait (walk), it also functions in controlling the movement of the limbs along with the axial skeleton by enabling their extensor muscles and inhibiting their flexor muscles.\n\n\"",

      "\"description_gastric_secretions\" : \"\n Gastric cells manufacture and secrete a number of enzymes and hormones that aid the process of digestion where a single cell type can release one or more elements.\n\n - Gastric secretory cells:\n \u25cf Chief cells: located at the body of the stomach, these function in the production and secretion of pepsinogen the precursor of the protein digesting enzyme pepsin and gastric lipase.\n\n \u25cf Parietal cells: located at the body of the stomach, these cells function on the production and secretion of hydrochloric acid and intrinsic factor.\n\n \u25cf G-cells: are neuroendocrine cells (neuronal cells that secrete hormones) located at the antrum of the stomach, these cells function in the production and secretion of gastrin, a stimulatory and trophic hormone.\n\n \u25cf Mucus cells: located at the pyloric part of the stomach, these cells produce and secrete the protective layer of mucus that inhibits the abrasive action of acids on the gastric wall.\n\n - Types of gastric secretions:\n \u25cf Pepsinogen: once secreted, pepsinogen binds to the hyrochloric acid causing a breakdown reaction of the pepsinogen into pepsin (for the function of pepsin, see GIT physiology - protein digestion).\n\n \u25cf Gastric lipase: is one of the three lipase enzymes that function in the breakdown of fat molecules, it requires a PH lower than 4 in order to maintain its function (for function of gastric lipase ,see GIT physiology - lipid digestion section).\n\n \u25cf Intrinsic factor: an element functioning in the absorption of vitamin B12 in the ileum, a crucial vitamin aiding in the process of red cell maturation. Decreased intrinsic factor results in less absorption of vitamin B12 leading to a pathologic hematological condition called pernicious anemia.\n\n \u25cf Gastrin: upon gastric wall distention, the activated stretch receptors send afferent impulses to the vagal nucleus in the brainstem which in turn sends efferent fibers to the submucousal plexus that stimulates G-cells to secrete gastrin. Being an endocrine hormone, gastrin is secreted into the blood circulation and is then carried to the gastric parietal cells to bind on the CCkB receptors to further stimulate the secretion hydrochloric acid.\n\n - Stimulation of hydrochloric acid secretion:\n \u25cf Gastrin: binds to the CCKB receptors on the parietal cell resulting in the upregulation of IP3 and calcium. This stimulates the hydrogen-potassium ATPase exchange pump to absorb more potassium and secrete more hydrogen into the gastric lumen.\n\n \u25cf Histamine: released by the enterochromaffin-like cells that are stimulated by gastrin, the histamin released binds to the H2 G-protein coupled receptors on the parietal cells activating adenylyl cyclase and up-regulates cyclic AMP resulting in the hyperstimulation of the hydrogen-potassium ATPase exchange pump.\n\n \u25cf Acetylcholine: when secreted by the submucousal plexus, it binds to the muscarinic M2 receptors of the parietal cells resulting in the up-regulation of IP3 and calcium which leads to further release of hydrogen protons into the gastric lumen via the hydrogen-potassium ATPase exchange pump.\n\n - Formation of hydrochloric acid: the CO2 and water in the parietal cell are combined in a reversible reaction catalyzed by carbonic anhydrase to form carbonic acid. The carbonic acid then splits to a hydrogen proton and a bicarbonate molecule, the bicarbonate leaves the cell into the blood circulation compartment in exchange of chloride via the chloride-bicarbonate exchange pump and the hydrogen proton leaves the cell into the gastric lumen compartment in exchange of potassium via the hydrogen-potasium exchange pump.\n\n - Phases of gastric secretions:\n \u25cf Cephalic phase: refers to the phase in which gastric cells have started secreting their digestive components but food is yet to enter the stomach, this is brought upon by sight, smell, and taste which activates the vagal center in the brainstem to send impulses to the submucousal plexus resulting in the stimulation of cell secretion, this phase helps the stomach being prepared to receive food.\n\n \u25cf Gastric phase: occurs when the stomach is distended from gastric contents that stimulate the vagal centers to release HCL acid and gastrin which further stimulates the release of HCL acid along with the partially hydrolyzed proteins that induce the secretion of gastrin and the histamine that helps in further secretion of HCL acid.\n\n \u25cf Intestinal phase: as long as chyme is present in the upper parts of the duodenum the gastric cells are stimulated by the gastro-intestinal reflex to keep on secreting their digestive factors.\n\n\"",
