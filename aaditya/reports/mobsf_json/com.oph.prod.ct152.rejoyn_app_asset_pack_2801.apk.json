    "title": "Rejoyn\u2122",
    "description": "Meet Rejoyn\u2122, the first and only add-on prescription app for the treatment of major depressive disorder symptoms, also known as depression. Rejoyn is authorized by the FDA for adults age 22+ who want to add to their antidepressant medication. Over the course of 6 weeks, Rejoyn delivers proven brain-training exercises and short skills-based therapy lessons. Unlike wellness apps, Rejoyn was studied in a phase 3 clinical trial and is classified as a medical device. Rejoyn requires a prescription from a healthcare provider. \r\n\r\nThe brain-training exercises in Rejoyn were developed and studied by a team of psychologists, psychiatrists, and neuroscientists. In a clinical trial, adding Rejoyn to antidepressant medication reduced depression symptoms with zero side effects related to Rejoyn. The exercises and lessons in Rejoyn tap into the brain's natural ability to change, known as neuroplasticity. You can think of it like physical therapy, but for your brain. Using Rejoyn for less than 2 hours per week for 6 weeks is designed to change how the brain works, which can improve depression symptoms.\r\n\r\nRejoyn core functionality also includes reminders to help keep you on schedule. For example, if your treatment session is interrupted, you will be prompted to return to complete your exercise within 15 minutes so that you don\u2019t lose your progress.\r\n\r\nInterested in trying Rejoyn? \r\nRejoyn must be prescribed by a healthcare provider. Talk to your provider about Rejoyn or learn how you can consult with a provider online at www.rejoyn.com. \r\n\r\nAlready have a prescription?\r\nDownload the app to get started. Once Rejoyn is downloaded, the app will guide you through setting up your account. \r\n\r\nFor more information, visit www.rejoyn.com.\r\n\r\nSee Patient Instructions for Use at https://www.rejoyn.com/Patient-Instructions-for-Use.pdf.\r\n\r\nINDICATION: Rejoyn is a prescription digital therapeutic for the treatment of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) symptoms as an adjunct to clinician-managed outpatient care for adult patients with MDD age 22 years and older who are on antidepressant medication. It is intended to reduce MDD symptoms. \r\n\r\nSAFETY INFORMATION: Rejoyn is not intended to be used as a standalone treatment. Rejoyn does not replace your current medication, including medication for treatment of MDD. You should continue your current treatment as directed by your healthcare provider.\r\n\r\nRejoyn cannot send alerts or warnings to your healthcare provider. If you feel that your depression symptoms are worsening or if you have feelings or thoughts of harming yourself or others, please contact your healthcare provider, dial 911, or go to the nearest emergency room immediately.\r\n\r\nTo review the developer\u2019s Privacy Policy, visit http://www.rejoyn.com/app-privacy-policy-html.\r\n\r\n\u00a9 2024 Otsuka Precision Health, Inc.
